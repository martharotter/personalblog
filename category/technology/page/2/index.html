		<p>Having recently read both <a title="On News and Advertising :: Contrast Blog" href="http://contrast.ie/blog/on-news-and-advertising/" target="_blank">Des Traynor&#8217;s article</a> on magazine versus print advertising and <a title="News Redux :: Andy Rutledge" href="http://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php" target="_blank">Andy Rutledge’s article</a> on digital news being broken, I have a new problem.&nbsp; I notice I&#8217;m suddenly much more conscious of advertisements on websites and applications I use. </p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Hotmail - martharotter@hotmail.com - Windows Live-1" border="0" alt="Hotmail - martharotter@hotmail.com - Windows Live-1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Hotmail-martharotterhotmail.com-Windows-Live-11.jpg" width="84" height="240"></p>
<p>This is a problem because I used to be <em>so good</em> at tuning out the bouncing &#8220;HERE I AM LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME&#8221; ads on the side of my browser.&nbsp; Today when I logged into an unnamed online account, I actually felt offended that this company decided it was okay for this obnoxious, attention-deprived ad to be in my face while I was trying to read and respond to email.&nbsp; I ended up sliding the browser over so the ad was off the page in order to actually concentrate on my email.</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t have to do that.&nbsp; How effective can an advertisement be if people are so annoyed by it they move it out of view?&nbsp; </p>
<p>And furthermore, do ads like this actually work?&nbsp; The image on Des’ blog post indicates that for many categories, click-through rates are <strong>under .1%</strong>. I&#8217;d love to know what the click-through rate is for specifically those ads that bounce around screaming “CLICK ON THE DANCING MONKEY NOW FOR A FREE IPAD!” and &#8220;OMG YOU&#8217;RE THE 5,553,024,203 VISITOR AND YOU *WON*!!!!!!!!!!!&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GUESS WHAT? I LIKE ADS.</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something that may surprise some website owners: I <strong>like</strong> ads. I read ads, I forward ads to my friends that are entertaining, I re-watch ads when they&#8217;re clever or funny, and I can still sing many jingles of ads I heard as a kid on the radio or television.&nbsp; In fact, as someone who spends a lot of money buying magazines and print publications, there are even some I buy for the ads.&nbsp; Magazines like Bon Appétit and Elle have such gorgeous pictures that I rarely read the majority of the articles, I flip through images, and I never care if they&#8217;re ads or part of the magazine. I am not anti-advertisements.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Magazine creators, unlike website owners, are not surprised that their readers like their ads.&nbsp; They already knew this, and that’s why their ad prices can be so high for their printed publications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHO IS MAKING MONEY FROM THESE ADS?</strong></p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is if or how these ugly website ads actually work.&nbsp; Google AdSense must make some people money, because I know people who have gotten cheques from them.&nbsp; But they&#8217;ve never made any money from me clicking on things.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see a website that curated its advertisements<img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 5px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Atlantic Magazine Ad" border="0" alt="Atlantic Magazine Ad" align="right" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-21.png" width="160" height="240"> as carefully as the print magazines I read do.&nbsp; If the advertisements online were as good as they are in print, I&#8217;d likely click or interact with them more.&nbsp; As an example, in the <a title="Tuesday Newsday :: The Atlantic Magazine" href="/tuesday-newsday-the-atlantic-magazine/" target="_blank">Atlantic app review I did last week</a>, the single ad was a very well done advertisement for the new 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS. I played with the ad for a while &amp; spent some time with it because it was cool and nicely done.&nbsp; (I’m not currently car shopping, but I would have interacted with many ads which were as well-designed as this one.)</p>
<p>Is that unrealistic?&nbsp; Most websites probably don&#8217;t have the time or money to hand-select advertisements or to be picky about them or send them back when they&#8217;re ugly.&nbsp; Plus many websites and applications use advertisement placement services, like Google AdSense, AdMob and Microsoft pubCenter, which don&#8217;t give them any control at all other than possibly the dimensions and the placement on the site for the ads and the option to exclude competitors or certain URLs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A BETTER WAY?</strong></p>
<p>What if there were another way?&nbsp; If you could use an ad placement service like AdSense and guarantee that the advertisements were of a certain quality bar or that they had been vetted by a graphic designer or someone with taste, wouldn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>People complain all the time about the fact that there is less and less money to be made from online advertising. I think many people are wasting opportunities by creating obnoxious and tasteless ads that don&#8217;t do any justice to their product.</p>
<p>Starting today I&#8217;m going to run a small experiment.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to see how long I can go without looking at bad online advertisements. When I come across a site that uses ads which drive me crazy, I&#8217;m going to put it on my &#8220;blocked&#8221; list.&nbsp; By the end of next week I will either have long since abandoned the idea as impossible or have created a list of sites that I no longer need to visit.&nbsp; But also I am hoping to find some sites that are shining examples of how to use great ads online.</p>

		<p>When you live and breathe one industry for most of your professional life, what happens?</p>
<p>Usually you end up living in a bit of a bubble.&nbsp; That bubble is reinforced when your friends, peers and colleagues are in the same industry.&nbsp; This is dangerous because it changes your perception of reality.</p>
<p>I recently moved from being a developer in the tech industry to being a techie in the publishing industry.&nbsp; Here are a few of the many things I have had to learn so far: </p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211; <strong>JUST SHIP IT: </strong>In software development, even when you’re trying to ship a product and the deadline has slipped and it’s massive panic all around, there still comes a time when people staying awake and checking in code does more damage than good.&nbsp; You tell everyone to go home, get some sleep and come back in the morning to finish the work.&nbsp; In publishing, there is no concept of go-home-before-you-do-more-damage.&nbsp; There is only the concept of the publisher’s deadline.&nbsp; Which is gospel.&nbsp; You stay until it’s published. </li>
</ul>

<li><strong>&#8211; NEW/SHINY == BAD: </strong>In the tech world, you can throw a new system, framework, device or design at people and they’ll intuitively figure out how it works.&nbsp; In the publishing world, people rely a great deal on their systems working the same way.&nbsp; You cannot introduce changes or features without ample training and/or documentation or you risk a massive productivity loss.
<li>&#8211; <strong>MY PHONE ISN’T BROKEN, THE SITE IS: </strong>Techies generally keep their software and devices up-to-date.&nbsp; We’re interested to know if the new features are good, if performance is improved or if security holes are fixed.&nbsp; Outside of the tech world, many people don’t update because they don’t know they can or they don’t know how or, more often, they just don’t care.&nbsp; Telling people to upgrade their iPhone software can come across as an insult instead of the helpful tip you thought it would be.</li>

<p>Why does any of this matter?</p>

<p>Living and working inside a bubble helps us to forget who our customers really are.&nbsp; I observed this in my first full-time job working on a brand new development framework at Microsoft (codename Avalon, now WPF).&nbsp; We spent months designing and architecting cool API test harnesses which dynamically integrated all APIs and extrapolated every possible combination of values.&nbsp; It was a tough piece of work but no one else had done it, and we were so proud.</p>
<p>Walking into a meeting with the other 100 people on the team, we sat down ready to hear praise for our unprecedented and forward-thinking accomplishment.&nbsp; Instead, the director got in front of us, said nothing and opened his laptop.&nbsp; He opened Visual Studio, selected “Create new Avalon project” and hit F5 to compile and run.&nbsp; Visual Studio crashed.&nbsp; In all our discussions about ascertaining perfect quality, we hadn’t once thought about who was going to use the framework and what their process would be like. We failed.&nbsp; From then on, at least 50% of my time was spent testing by “using the product as a customer.”&nbsp; We shipped a much better product because of that change.</p>
<p>As G.I. Joe used to say, “Knowing is half the battle.”&nbsp; Knowing you are in a bubble is the first step towards being able to change your behaviour and do the right thing for whoever your customers are.&nbsp; My customers right now are editors, copy chiefs, photography editors and print designers.&nbsp; I still have a lot to learn, but each time I observe their work styles and habits, I can creep a little bit more out of my bubble and build a little bit better software for them to use.</p>

		<p>Funemployment is over.&nbsp; I have work to do.</p>
<p>I made the decision last summer, when I was starting to look at new jobs, that I no longer wanted a full-time, all-consuming job.&nbsp; I made a list of what I wanted, and it looked like this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Time to work on my own projects (2 days a week)<br />&#8211; Time to continue my graduate course work in computational linguistics and data visualisation (1 day a week)<br />&#8211; Working from home<br />&#8211; Working with smart people from whom I can learn loads<br />&#8211; The opportunity to teach others<br />&#8211; Cutting-edge technology<br />&#8211; Work in areas I’m passionate about: media, publishing, mobile, news<br />&#8211; Ability to continue to travel<br />&#8211; Complete ownership of my schedule<br />&#8211; Last but not least: stay in Ireland (at least until my visa runs out!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might be the luckiest person I know – things are working out great so far.&nbsp; Here’s what I’m working on: </p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="National College of Ireland" border="0" alt="National College of Ireland" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image1.png" width="155" height="102"> </p>
<p><strong><u>LECTURING:</u></strong> I have accepted a part-time lecturing position at the <a title="National College of Ireland website" href="http://www.ncirl.ie/" target="_blank">National College of Ireland</a> for the Advanced Rich Internet Applications piece of their new <a title="MSc in Web Technologies program overview" href="http://www.ncirl.ie/Programmes_Courses/Part-time-Courses/MSc-in-Web-Technologies-part-time-MSCWEBTECH1" target="_blank">MSc in Web Technologies program</a>.&nbsp; I start at the end of January, and I can’t express how much I’m looking forward to it.&nbsp; During my time at Microsoft Ireland, my absolute favourite part of my job was being able to take small groups of developers and teach programming concepts and new technology designs.&nbsp; I love teaching, so I can’t wait to get started.</p>
<p><strong><u>PERSONAL PROJECTS:</u></strong> I’m continuing to work on my own projects, which are small prototypes that I will probably blog about later.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Nomad Editions " border="0" alt="Nomad Editions " src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/NomadLogo114.jpg" width="114" height="114"></p>
<p><strong><u>NEW TECHNOLOGY:</u></strong> And lastly but most exciting, I’ve joined the team at <a title="Nomad Editions" href="http://readnomad.com/" target="_blank">Nomad Editions</a> as their tech lead.&nbsp; I can’t think of an area I’m more passionate about right now than digital magazines.&nbsp; I’ve been a magazine junkie my whole life, and what magazines are doing with their digital versions is absolutely breaking my heart.&nbsp; Nomad Editions is a mobile-focused start-up based in New York doing the <strong><em>right</em></strong> thing for magazine and news readers as well as anyone who loves narratives and storytelling.&nbsp; Nomad Editions are small, focused weekly magazines downloaded to your desktop/laptop/phone/tablet/device that look amazing, no matter how you’re reading them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are a foodie, a surfer or a film buff, you can sign up for the free beta trials now at <a href="http://nomadeditions.com/">http://nomadeditions.com</a>.&nbsp; Or follow us on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/readnomad">http://twitter.com/readnomad</a> (each magazine has its own feed as well which I’ve listed here: <a href="http://twitter.com/martharotter/nomadeditions-15">http://twitter.com/martharotter/nomadeditions-15</a>).&nbsp; Working with fantastically smart people like Petr van Blokland, Roger Black, Filipe Fortes and the superstar Nomad team means I’m learning all the time from the best of the best, which is an unbelievable opportunity.</p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Nomad Editions Magazines" border="0" alt="Nomad Editions Magazines" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image2.png" width="483" height="166">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nomad Editions runs on top of Treesaver technology, designed and built by <a title="Filipe Fortes" href="http://fortes.com/" target="_blank">Filipe Fortes</a>.&nbsp; Treesaver is what makes Nomad work cross-browser/cross-platform/cross-device and look amazing the whole time.&nbsp; To learn more about Treesaver, you can <a title="Treesaver on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/trsvr/" target="_blank">follow @trsvr on Twitter</a><font size="3">.&nbsp; This video interview with Robert Scoble gives an excellent overview of Treesaver’s origins and how it works: <a title="Treesaver Shows HTML5 Can Hold its Own Against Flipboard-style Design" href="http://scoble.it/h77h0T">Treesaver Shows HTML5 Can Hold its Own Against Flipboard-style Design</a>.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>So that’s what I’m up to for the next few months.&nbsp; I’ll be in New York city next week for some new Nomad Editions developments and I’ll definitely have some news to blog about after that.</p>

		<p>I knew that various parts of the web are blocked inside of China, but I didn’t realize how much it would actually affect me during my five days there.&nbsp; Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TwitPic, Tumblr, Dropbox, Foursquare, Vimeo, various Google services (Calendar, Reader), certain news sites, podcast downloads.&nbsp; All of these things were inaccessible while I was there.&nbsp; I of course tried loads of VPN services and proxy clients but couldn’t get any to connect.</p>
<p>It didn’t stop at the web, though.&nbsp; SMS messages to my family were garbled (this happened to both my friend Karen and me, and we were on different networks: MaxRoam (me) and O2 (Karen), so it didn’t seem to be a carrier issue) or just didn’t make it.&nbsp; I missed loads of incoming SMS messages as well.&nbsp; I can’t explain how frustrating it is to feel completely cut off from your friends and family.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At the Lhasa airport on the way back to Kathmandu, I used Maxroam to call my family and it worked great.&nbsp; I couldn’t wait to get back to Nepal and catch up more with folks.&nbsp; It made me realize that even though I can go weeks without using the web when I want to disconnect, I do miss them when I know they’re there and I can’t get to them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It felt silly, because how much do you really miss when you don’t read Twitter or Facebook for a few days?&nbsp; Usually not terribly much.&nbsp; In fact I rarely use them or any of the other blocked sites I mentioned above when I’m on holidays.&nbsp; But I returned to Kathmandu feeling like I had been in outer space for a year.&nbsp; It’s a very strange feeling.</p>

		<p>I deserve to be an amazing packer with all the travel I have done for work and for fun.&#160; But I’m actually a terrible packer.&#160; What gives?</p>
<p>Travelling with technology can make a trip so much better and easier, but gadget-lovers like me often find it hard to distinguish between “It would be nice to have this with me” and “I would be stupid to not bring this.” </p>
<p>I have taken trips with three or four laptops, external hard drives, spare wireless keyboards and mice, loads of phones, and even an Xbox 360 plus games/rockband/controllers/etc.&#160; It can be stressful to travel with so much gear, to say the least.</p>
<p>However when I’m not travelling for work, I have different things to worry about.&#160; On my recent trip to Nepal and Tibet, I pared it down to the following: </p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>&#160; * Samsung NC-10 netbook (for blogging, Skype, Kindle app, backing up photos, photo-editing, writing &amp; e-mail)        <br />* Logitech headset &amp; mic (for Skype &amp; conference calls – I know it’s holidays but I still had a few things to take care of)&#160; <br />* Zune 120 mp3 player (for music, audiobooks, games &amp; podcasts – I had a lot of plane &amp; bus time)         <br />* Two Windows Mobile 6.1 phones (for wifi, SMS &amp; phone calls &#8212; I had two SIM cards I had to travel with, and swapping SIMs all the time is a pain)         <br />* Sony NEX-5 camera with an extra lens &amp; external flash         <br />* chargers/converters for everything </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>That might sound like a lot, but all of it fit in my handy day pack, and it was great.&#160; And before anyone replies with “why didn’t you just bring an iphone/android/macbook/wii/vacuum/whatever”, I didn’t want to buy any more <em>stuff </em>for this trip except for the camera (which I love &amp; highly recommend!).&#160; So I went with what I had.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Too Many Laptops" border="0" alt="Too Many Laptops" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/farewell.png" width="187" height="234" /></p>
<p>It was a tough call between the iPad and the netbook, but the keyboard and the built-in SD card-reader (along with the lack of paranoia) made the netbook a better choice, so I left the iPad at home with a delighted babysitter.</p>
<p>My next trip is home to Missouri for Thanksgiving later this month, so I’ll see if I can consolidate a bit more.&#160; Recommendations welcome!</p>
