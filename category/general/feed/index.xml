								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last three years, my blog has been at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/martharotter">http://blogs.msdn.com/martharotter</a>.&nbsp; It was appropriate because I started blogging as an experiment to see if I thought I would enjoy evangelism.&nbsp; I loved it, and kept my blog there since 2007.&nbsp; Mostly I blogged about new Microsoft technology, initiatives and events for Irish developers my team and I were running, and occasionally personal posts about my life in Ireland or my family or travels.</p>
<p>Friday, September 24th, 2010 was my last day at Microsoft after nine-and-a-half years.&nbsp; It’s still hard to believe I was there that long.&nbsp; But now it’s time to do something different, so it seemed appropriate to transfer my blog to a new home and change its focus a bit.&nbsp; I’ll still blog about the things I’m passionate about such as web and mobile technology, just now with a bit wider lens.</p>
<p>I’m very excited to get back to building and architecting things, so I’m looking forward to creating new projects and blogging about them.&nbsp; Thanks for joining me here.</p>
