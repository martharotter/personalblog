		<p>Having recently read both <a title="On News and Advertising :: Contrast Blog" href="http://contrast.ie/blog/on-news-and-advertising/" target="_blank">Des Traynor&#8217;s article</a> on magazine versus print advertising and <a title="News Redux :: Andy Rutledge" href="http://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php" target="_blank">Andy Rutledge’s article</a> on digital news being broken, I have a new problem.&nbsp; I notice I&#8217;m suddenly much more conscious of advertisements on websites and applications I use. </p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Hotmail - martharotter@hotmail.com - Windows Live-1" border="0" alt="Hotmail - martharotter@hotmail.com - Windows Live-1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Hotmail-martharotterhotmail.com-Windows-Live-11.jpg" width="84" height="240"></p>
<p>This is a problem because I used to be <em>so good</em> at tuning out the bouncing &#8220;HERE I AM LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME&#8221; ads on the side of my browser.&nbsp; Today when I logged into an unnamed online account, I actually felt offended that this company decided it was okay for this obnoxious, attention-deprived ad to be in my face while I was trying to read and respond to email.&nbsp; I ended up sliding the browser over so the ad was off the page in order to actually concentrate on my email.</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t have to do that.&nbsp; How effective can an advertisement be if people are so annoyed by it they move it out of view?&nbsp; </p>
<p>And furthermore, do ads like this actually work?&nbsp; The image on Des’ blog post indicates that for many categories, click-through rates are <strong>under .1%</strong>. I&#8217;d love to know what the click-through rate is for specifically those ads that bounce around screaming “CLICK ON THE DANCING MONKEY NOW FOR A FREE IPAD!” and &#8220;OMG YOU&#8217;RE THE 5,553,024,203 VISITOR AND YOU *WON*!!!!!!!!!!!&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GUESS WHAT? I LIKE ADS.</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something that may surprise some website owners: I <strong>like</strong> ads. I read ads, I forward ads to my friends that are entertaining, I re-watch ads when they&#8217;re clever or funny, and I can still sing many jingles of ads I heard as a kid on the radio or television.&nbsp; In fact, as someone who spends a lot of money buying magazines and print publications, there are even some I buy for the ads.&nbsp; Magazines like Bon Appétit and Elle have such gorgeous pictures that I rarely read the majority of the articles, I flip through images, and I never care if they&#8217;re ads or part of the magazine. I am not anti-advertisements.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Magazine creators, unlike website owners, are not surprised that their readers like their ads.&nbsp; They already knew this, and that’s why their ad prices can be so high for their printed publications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHO IS MAKING MONEY FROM THESE ADS?</strong></p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is if or how these ugly website ads actually work.&nbsp; Google AdSense must make some people money, because I know people who have gotten cheques from them.&nbsp; But they&#8217;ve never made any money from me clicking on things.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see a website that curated its advertisements<img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 5px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Atlantic Magazine Ad" border="0" alt="Atlantic Magazine Ad" align="right" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-21.png" width="160" height="240"> as carefully as the print magazines I read do.&nbsp; If the advertisements online were as good as they are in print, I&#8217;d likely click or interact with them more.&nbsp; As an example, in the <a title="Tuesday Newsday :: The Atlantic Magazine" href="/tuesday-newsday-the-atlantic-magazine/" target="_blank">Atlantic app review I did last week</a>, the single ad was a very well done advertisement for the new 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS. I played with the ad for a while &amp; spent some time with it because it was cool and nicely done.&nbsp; (I’m not currently car shopping, but I would have interacted with many ads which were as well-designed as this one.)</p>
<p>Is that unrealistic?&nbsp; Most websites probably don&#8217;t have the time or money to hand-select advertisements or to be picky about them or send them back when they&#8217;re ugly.&nbsp; Plus many websites and applications use advertisement placement services, like Google AdSense, AdMob and Microsoft pubCenter, which don&#8217;t give them any control at all other than possibly the dimensions and the placement on the site for the ads and the option to exclude competitors or certain URLs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A BETTER WAY?</strong></p>
<p>What if there were another way?&nbsp; If you could use an ad placement service like AdSense and guarantee that the advertisements were of a certain quality bar or that they had been vetted by a graphic designer or someone with taste, wouldn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>People complain all the time about the fact that there is less and less money to be made from online advertising. I think many people are wasting opportunities by creating obnoxious and tasteless ads that don&#8217;t do any justice to their product.</p>
<p>Starting today I&#8217;m going to run a small experiment.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to see how long I can go without looking at bad online advertisements. When I come across a site that uses ads which drive me crazy, I&#8217;m going to put it on my &#8220;blocked&#8221; list.&nbsp; By the end of next week I will either have long since abandoned the idea as impossible or have created a list of sites that I no longer need to visit.&nbsp; But also I am hoping to find some sites that are shining examples of how to use great ads online.</p>

		<p>If you’re working in the area of content strategy, writing, developing or designing web sites, marketing or anything in between, you should probably be planning on heading to the <a title="CS Forum :: London" href="http://2011.csforum.eu/" target="_blank">Content Strategy Forum in London</a> from September 5th – 7th.</p>
<p><a title="CS Forum :: London" href="http://2011.csforum.eu/" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image4.png" alt="image" width="246" height="224" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>CS Forum has excellent speakers including Karen McGrane, Gerry McGovern, Kristina Halvorson, Erin Kissane.  They’ll be covering everything from the value of content, techniques and tools, user experience design, business models, videos and much more. If you look closely you may even recognize some local speakers including <a title="Des Traynor" href="http://2011.csforum.eu/speakers/traynor" target="_blank">Des Traynor</a>, <a title="Cory-Ann Joseph" href="http://2011.csforum.eu/speakers/joseph" target="_blank">Cory-Ann Joseph</a>, and <a title="Martha Rotter @ CS Forum London" href="http://2011.csforum.eu/speakers/rotter" target="_blank">myself</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WORKSHOP DETAILS: </strong></p>
<p>My workshop, <a title="CS Forum Workshops" href="http://2011.csforum.eu/workshops" target="_blank">Designing Narrative Content</a>, is designed to help people answer the question of “How can I make sure that <em>everything I’m doing</em> helps to reach the widest audience possible with my content, technology and overall strategy?”  It’s a hands-on workshop, so attendees will actually walk away with their own publishing strategy and even a sample publication online and live!</p>
<p>In order to build and lay everything out, we’ll use a new technology called <a title="Treesaver" href="http://treesaver.net/">Treesaver</a> to dynamically produce our content and allow people to view it everywhere.  But don’t be scared if you think you’re not a developer, we’re not focusing on the dev part, we’re just focusing on the content.  You won’t have to know how to create HTML from scratch.  If you are familiar with HTML &amp; CSS, then you’ll be able to customize your experience a good bit more but it won’t be necessary.</p>
<p>If you are working with narrative content, long-form content, any form of digital publishing (including magazines, newspapers, eBooks), <span class="pullquote">this workshop will save you a lot of time and money</span> in understanding how to design more content with small teams and small budgets.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the workshop and want to know more about it, please feel free to <a title="e-mail Martha" href="mailto:hi@martharotter.com">e-mail me for more information</a> or <a title="Martha on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/martharotter" target="_blank">contact me on Twitter</a>.  If there is something you’d like to see added to the workshop, now would be a great time to let me know while I still have time to alter the presentation and exercises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEW:</strong></p>
<p><a title="Randall Snare on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/randallsnare" target="_blank">Randall Snare</a> interviewed me recently about my workshop and views on the field as well as what Indian palm readers predict for my very near future.  You can read that interview here for a bit more insight: <a href="http://blog.csforum.eu/articles/narrative-content-martha-rotter-preview">http://blog.csforum.eu/articles/narrative-content-martha-rotter-preview</a>.</p>

		<p>It would have been difficult to not notice Amazon’s launch of their new web app for reading Kindle books last week.  Part of the reason is because it’s a very easy-to-use and intuitive app.  But mostly the noise was about the fact that Amazon had very cleverly bypassed Apple’s 30% cut.</p>
<p><a title="Kindle cloud reader" href="https://read.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Kindle Cloud Reader" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image.png" alt="Kindle Cloud Reader" width="479" height="467" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Apple, as any app developer knows, take a 30% cut of anything sold in their App Store.  Recently this was extended and enforced for in-app and subscription-type purchases.  For many applications this is a tough but reasonable ask.  Apple have created the infrastructure and provided the customers to allow them to make money; they deserve some money to continue to build and enhance this infrastructure.</p>
<p>But for other companies it was tougher to swallow.  Companies like Amazon who already make very slim margins on book sales may not be able to spare 30% of that price and break even, let alone make a profit.  Other companies, <a title="iFlow Reader" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=iflowreader" target="_blank">like iFlow Reader</a>, were already making less than 30% profit on sales of in-app purchases, and <span class="pullquote">Apple’s updated terms forced them to go out of business</span>.</p>
<p>So I am not alone in rejoicing for Amazon’s success here, as it proves that small publishing companies and companies with low profit margins don’t have to sigh and accept the revenue loss as part of the system.  The Kindle Cloud Reader is not a complex app, and as you’ll see below, it actually has some nice benefits over the native app in terms of user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WILL PEOPLE USE THIS IN LIEU OF THE NATIVE KINDLE READER? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, but it may take time.  The updated version of the native Kindle Reader application for iOS now has had to remove all links to the Amazon store, so you can’t shop for new books via the iOS app.  Granted, it previously just bounced you into Safari anyway, but now it’s extra awkward.  Not everyone will notice this right away, but as people finish their books and go looking for more books to purchase or download, they will realize this isn’t an option anymore and have to go to the Amazon website instead.</p>
<p>The other thing Amazon has going for it is very valuable ad placement: the front page of <a href="http://amazon.com/">http://amazon.com</a>.  Millions of people will see that link and click to find out what it is.  The developers have done a great job of making this transition very easy so I don’t expect they will lose many people in the move from the native to the web app.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Amazon.com home page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image1.png" alt="Amazon.com home page" width="512" height="395" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DOES IT WORK EVERYWHERE?</strong></p>
<p>Visiting <a href="http://read.amazon.com/">http://read.amazon.com</a> on my iPhone showed me a “your browser is not supported” message.  Scrolling down showed that Kindle Cloud Reader is supported in Chrome for Mac/PC/Linux/Chromebook, Safari for Mac/PC and Safari for iPad (iOS 4+), but I have to imagine the iPhone is just a matter of time.  It doesn’t mention anything on the horizon for iPhone, Android, Windows Phone 7 or anything else, hopefully that will be updated soon.  Amazon have stated that they’ve built the app from the ground up in HTML5, so for browsers which support HTML5 it will likely just be a bit of time for them to have it working in more places.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Unsupported Message" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image2.png" alt="Unsupported Message" width="479" height="489" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO THE NATIVE KINDLE APP?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no denying that the native app and the web app are incredibly similar.  Launching both apps takes about the same amount of time and differs only by the splash pages.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Launching Kindle native app" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-13-29-24.png" alt="Launching Kindle native app" width="253" height="347" border="0" />  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Launching Cloud Reader" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-48-13.png" alt="Launching Cloud Reader" width="256" height="347" border="0" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve opened the app, you’re presented with two options: view the items you’ve purchases (called “Archived Items” in the native app, “Cloud” in the web app) or view the items you’ve downloaded (called “Home” in the native app, “Downloaded” in the web app).</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Native Kindle Main Menu" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-15-13-43.png" alt="Native Kindle Main Menu" width="248" height="336" border="0" />  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Kindle Cloud Reader Main Menu" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-53-28.png" alt="Kindle Cloud Reader Main Menu" width="248" height="336" border="0" /></p>
<p>From there, the main difference is the ability to browse and purchase books, and <span class="pullquote">this is where the Kindle Cloud Reader really shines</span>.  You have a button for “Kindle Store” in the top right, and this takes you to a very nicely designed store where you can get recommendations, search, view lists of bestsellers, download sample chapters and read descriptions and reviews of books.</p>
<p>Because it’s customized for the iPad, the size and touch aspects of the store are excellent.  Browsing, reading and searching are very easy and much smoother than the previous experience of having the Kindle Reader open Safari and then zooming and panning to browse and search for books.</p>
<p align="justify"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Button for Kindle Store in Cloud Reader " src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image3.png" alt="Button for Kindle Store in Cloud Reader " width="250" height="343" border="0" />    <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Cloud Reader Store" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-49-28.png" alt="Cloud Reader Store" width="250" height="343" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LET’S TAKE A QUICK TOUR: </strong></p>
<p>Using the Kindle Cloud Reader is as easy as visiting <a href="http://read.amazon.com/">http://read.amazon.com</a>. On the iPad, you’ll first need to log in to your Amazon account so it can sync any books you’ve purchased already.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Sign in to Kindle Cloud Reader" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-15-39-23.png" alt="Sign in to Kindle Cloud Reader" width="299" height="405" border="0" /></p>
<p>After signing in, you’re presented with some pretty standard instructions for adding a bookmark to your Home Screen, followed by requesting permission to increase the database size so it can store books on your iPad for you to read offline.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Kindle Cloud Reader Install Instructions" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-47-27.png" alt="Kindle Cloud Reader Install Instructions" width="235" height="321" border="0" />  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Adding Kindle Cloud Reader to Home Screen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-47-32.png" alt="Adding Kindle Cloud Reader to Home Screen" width="234" height="321" border="0" /></p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Giving Kindle Cloud Reader permission to store books" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-47-10.png" alt="Giving Kindle Cloud Reader permission to store books" width="310" height="425" border="0" /></p>
<p>After these few quick steps, you’re in your “Cloud” page, which shows you any purchases you’ve ever made from the Kindle store.  To read any book, click on its cover.  It will open the book in a reading view and you now have the familiar Kindle reading experience.  Swipe to change pages, use the navigation at the top to move between the current page, the cover, the table of contents, etc.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Reading View of Kindle Cloud Reader" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-55-51.png" alt="Reading View of Kindle Cloud Reader" width="231" height="313" border="0" />  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Navigating in Kindle Cloud Reader" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-56-08.png" alt="Navigating in Kindle Cloud Reader" width="230" height="312" border="0" /></p>
<p>You can change font size, background and text colours, and set bookmarks for yourself.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Changing font size and colour" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-56-00.png" alt="Changing font size and colour" width="233" height="316" border="0" />  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Setting bookmarks" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-12-57-54.png" alt="Setting bookmarks" width="234" height="317" border="0" /></p>
<p>When you’re finished reading, Kindle Cloud Reader syncs your position so that should you go back to that book on another browser, a Kindle device, or a different Kindle Reader app (such as the native iPhone app), you’ll sync to wherever you left the book.  Simply click the “Library” button to go back to the main page or close the app by pressing the home button on your iPad.</p>
<p>If you’re planning on being offline for a while, you can download books to your iPad as well.  Press and hold a book cover, and you’ll get an option to “Download &amp; Pin Book” and an option to “Open Book.”  Downloading and pinning the book will save the book so you can read it even when you’re not connected to the internet.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Download &amp; Pin Book" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-15-54-33.png" alt="Download &amp; Pin Book" width="243" height="329" border="0" />  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Saving the book to your iPad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-16-08-2011-15-54-38.png" alt="Saving the book to your iPad" width="243" height="329" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OVERALL: </strong></p>
<p>Well done to Amazon.  This is an easy-to-use app built in HTML5 which works very well wherever it is currently supported.  This means they can add new features and update the app more quickly across all platforms and of course, very important for publishers and distributors of print and media, can retain their profits without paying the Apple tax.  The performance is no different to its counterpart native app, so I can’t see any reason that I would continue using the old native Kindle Reader iPad app. The store is very cleanly integrated and a great way to browse and purchase.  I’m <span class="pullquote">looking forward to seeing more applications like this and less companies like iFlow Reader failing</span>.</p>
<p>(And for those who noticed it all over my reading lists, yes <em>Bossypants</em> by Tina Fey is a fantastic and hilarious book and you should go read it.  On the Kindle Cloud Reader.)</p>

		<p><a title="The Atlantic" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a> has some of the best contemporary writing and photography today, showcased in their excellent monthly magazine (10 issues annually), their news and updates website <a title="The Atlantic Wire" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/" target="_blank">The Atlantic Wire</a> and now their iPad version: The Atlantic Magazine: Digital Edition, which was just relaunched a week ago after a year in development.</p>
<p><a title="Link to The Atlantic Magazine: Digital Edition on the App Store" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/theatlantic/id343217035?mt=8" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Link to The Atlantic Magazine: Digital Edition on the App Store" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-13-53-12.png" alt="Link to The Atlantic Magazine: Digital Edition on the App Store" width="291" height="398" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Many iPad magazines go with the model of “download our app for free and you can browse issues, then buy a subscription or single edition when you want to actually read the content.”  In the same way that paying the same price for a Kindle version as a paperback version seems odd to many, paying $5 or so for a sort-of-PDF copy still feels expensive to a lot of people, which is one of many reasons tablet magazine revenue is still slow.</p>
<p>The Atlantic, however, takes a nice approach and delivers both free and paid content in the same app.  The universal app (works on the iPad, iPod and iPhone) was released on July 29th, and its top purchase is already the annual digital subscription, which is promising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>WILL PEOPLE PAY WHEN THERE’S A LOT OF FREE CONTENT?</strong></span></p>
<p>News and magazine apps are full of regularly updated content, and in the case of The Atlantic, it’s very well-written and professional content as well.  So why would someone pay for a subscription or individual magazine?</p>
<p>In the case of well-known publications respected for their high quality content like The New Yorker, The Economist and The Atlantic: yes.</p>
<p>In the case of this app, I would easily pay for certain issues like the fiction issue for its excellent writing.  But after spending some time with it, it’s obvious that while the free articles are great, <span class="pullquote">the quality and reading experience are better in the actual magazine</span>.  I bought one issue to test it out, and it made me realize that a lot of people may miss out on seeing this experience because there isn’t a way to try that out.  The style, layout and UI of the magazine and free content are both good but both very different.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Opening Page of The Atlantic on the iPad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-14-09-39.png" alt="Opening Page of The Atlantic on the iPad" width="305" height="418" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>iPAD VERSUS iPHONE/iPOD EXPERIENCE:</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 10px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="iPhone Intro Screen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo.png" alt="iPhone Intro Screen" width="160" height="240" align="right" border="0" />The experience on the iPad is slightly different from that of the smaller devices.  On the iPhone, there is no option to subscribe, so the content is all from the web.  It’s a well-designed experience for a compact screen.  Instead of trying to cram in the rows of image boxes, it has a nice sliding panel with the eight top stories of the moment, so you can swipe through the top stories and see larger pictures before you decide which one you want to read.  The navigation is mostly the same with the category titles at the top.  Clicking on the individual articles puts in sort of a frame-within-a-frame.  I found this to feel a bit “squished” since the menu and ad below take up a good amount of vertical space.  It would be nice to take this to a full-screen view to get a bit more space.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-2.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Top Stories Navigation" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-2_thumb.png" alt="Top Stories Navigation" width="160" height="240" border="0" /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/articleList.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Article List" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/articleList_thumb.png" alt="Article List" width="164" height="244" border="0" /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/articleIphone.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 10px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Article on iPhone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/articleIphone_thumb.png" alt="Article on iPhone" width="164" height="244" border="0" /></a></p>
<p align="center">The iPad on the other hand does allow users to subscribe and purchase individual issues.  I’ll focus mostly on the iPad since that experience has a good bit more content and has the interesting contrast between the magazine and web content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY?</strong></p>
<p>The Atlantic’s app was built by RareWire, who have stated that the app consists mostly of XML, around 3,000 lines to be more exact.  RareWire mentioned at the launch of The Atlantic that they are planning on making their “RareWire App Creation Studio” available in the upcoming weeks for other publishers who want to create a similar app based on existing feeds and don’t have the skills in-house to build Objective C apps themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GIVE US THE RUN-DOWN</strong></p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 5px 6px 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Subscription Options" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-14-09-12.png" alt="Subscription Options" width="271" height="367" align="right" border="0" />Opening the app looks good, the design is nice and the navigation is very intuitive.  Upon launching the app you get an option to connect your already-purchased subscription with the app, subscribe, or just read the free content.  The app updates the content with live feeds which takes a very short amount of time.  Almost instantly you have an ad in front of you which you can easily close.</p>
<p>The settings of the app allow you to subscribe for a year or connect an existing subscription.  There’s a way to set the default view of the app so that it goes to the main page, the magazine, the photo stories or the news channels when it launches.  Settings also includes a link to e-mail feedback or get tech support.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Advertisement" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-13-54-38.png" alt="Advertisement" width="223" height="310" border="0" />     <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="App Settings" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-14-09-551.png" alt="App Settings" width="223" height="313" border="0" /></p>
<p>There’s just something very Flipboard-y or Pulse-y about the layout, however, which I can’t put my finger on.  When you click on the “Top News” button, everything is the same size and therefore given the same amount of importance. For some reason it doesn’t feel right. The place where that layout works great, on the other hand, is in the “In Focus” section, the collection of photo essays.  The photographs are beautiful and you can choose to swipe through different collections with or without the captions and credits.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="In Focus: Photo Gallery" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-16-05-37.png" alt="In Focus: Photo Gallery" width="298" height="404" border="0" /></p>
<p>In the individual channel pages, such as Business or Technology, it’s not clear whether the articles are ordered by most recent story or by top stories.  I assume that the top three images are the top stories for that category.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="International News Category" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-14-11-04.png" alt="International News Category" width="311" height="422" border="0" /></p>
<p>I mentioned above about the articles on the iPhone app feeling a bit squished.  The iPad app in portrait mode has a similar feeling although it’s less obvious.  The menu and navigation at the top and the related articles and ad at the bottom make it feel crowded.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-16-29-07.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Photo 09-08-2011 16 29 07" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-16-29-07_thumb.png" alt="Photo 09-08-2011 16 29 07" width="306" height="413" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Moving in to the magazine feels very familiar to many existing magazine apps.  There is navigation at the bottom to select various issues, and the same navigation of the app remains at the top so you can go back to the news channels or photo gallery.  Each magazine issue allows you to swipe through the table of contents (although it is small so a bit difficult to read) as well as purchase that individual issue or an annual subscription.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Magazine Section" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-15-47-36.png" alt="Magazine Section" width="302" height="409" border="0" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve purchased and downloaded an issue, it’s again quite similar to many iPad magazine experiences.  You have a hideable navigation bar at the bottom, help information and links to specific regular columns.  The rest of the magazine is the same sort of PDF-ish feel.  Interestingly, clicking on a story name on the magazine cover or table of contents also navigates you to that article.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Navigating a Magazine" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-15-48-23.png" alt="Navigating a Magazine" width="272" height="369" border="0" /></p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Magazine Reading View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-17-03-45.png" alt="Magazine Reading View" width="289" height="392" align="right" border="0" />I want to discuss the reading experience in the magazine versus the free content.  In the magazine, each page is fairly static and you can pinch and zoom to increase text size or image size.  There are some videos but I couldn’t get any to play very long without crashing.  However clicking the “Reading View” button at the top was a very nice experience.  The chrome was gone, and I was left with no distractions in my reading: just a small picture and the article text.  In this view, you can also click an “articles” button at the top right to view other articles in the issue in the same way.  You can select and copy text (not an option in most magazines), pinch and zoom and scroll vertically through the article.  I loved this reading experience and it’s something I would definitely pay for: the lack of distractions.  I did feel as if I were missing out on some of the art of the articles, and I went back to several articles to page through them after reading them in the reading view, just to see the images.  In most of the articles, I hadn’t actually missed out on anything but ads.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Reading Web Articles" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-16-24-55.png" alt="Reading Web Articles" width="284" height="389" align="right" border="0" />Contrast that with the reading experience of the free content in the app.  Clicking on an article in one of the news channels gives you the article with photos and text, but there’s chrome around the article and no reading view.  Clicking the “Like” button added a less-than arrow in the article nav bar, but I never figured out what it was for.  Clicking the heart icon adds the article to your favourites section, but I couldn’t find a way to remove articles from there.  So there are a few odd UI things.   The disqus comments embedded at the bottom seem like a good idea, but they contribute to the reader feeling he or she is on the web anyway and not in an app designed for reading.  Plus the login mechanism is separate again so you have to also log in to disqus to post anything. The magazine reader in me wishes that stuff stayed on the website.  The good thing about reading the web content however is that it works fine in both portrait and landscape, whereas the magazine doesn’t seem to adjust (and usually crashed when I tried).</p>
<p>I’ll differentiate between sharing in a magazine article and sharing the free content as well.  In the magazine, you get a small overlay that actually contains the title of every article in the magazine issue.  For each one, you can select a variety of share options, and this is the first time I have ever seen the option to share via LinkedIn.  This overlay interface is strange because it looks confusing at first, and a few times I didn’t remember the exact title of the article I was reading. However in terms of actual implementation, it works much better than the free content sharing.  The e-mail sharing sends a link to the article on the website and it works great.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Sharing in Magazine" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-15-58-33.png" alt="Sharing in Magazine" width="244" height="338" border="0" />     <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Sharing in Web Articles" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-14-14-44.png" alt="Sharing in Web Articles" width="241" height="334" border="0" /></p>
<p>The free content gives you the option to share via Twitter, Facebook and e-mail like many publications.  I did not like it at all because you have no options to edit, you simply see a small fade-in message box telling you the article has been Tweeted or linked on Facebook.  This always bothers me because you have no idea what your tweet or Facebook link actually says.  In the case of Facebook, it kept giving me the login screen and never accepted my credentials.  It did end up posting one link however.  The Twitter integration never worked for me, but it did continue to tell me my links were being tweeted.</p>
<p>Something I expected to work at least in the iPad version is fast-app switching but the app does not support it and always starts from the beginning. So if you’re in the middle of an article you’ll have to remember where you were the next time you launch the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OVERALL</strong></p>
<p>I’ll be honest, while the first time I downloaded and launched this application last week on my iPad it was fairly smooth, this week I have had a lot of problems just getting the iPad app to launch without crashing.  I don’t know if the app is very memory-heavy or if the technology is just new and buggy.  As it’s relying on live feeds, it could also suffer if one or more of those is overloaded or simply down.  I tried reinstalling a couple of times and killing all the other running apps on my iPad, but that didn’t seem to affect it. So hopefully it’s an intermittent issue or will be fixed in the next update.  I’ll try again tomorrow and see (<em>note: this wasn’t an issue on the iPhone version, just the iPad</em>).</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Reading In Magazine" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-16-58-45.png" alt="Reading In Magazine" width="257" height="360" align="left" border="0" /><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Tweeting from Free Article" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Photo-09-08-2011-14-13-45.png" alt="Tweeting from Free Article" width="257" border="0" /></p>
<p>Because the magazine is such a different reading experience, The Atlantic should consider offering one issue to download and read for free.  Or use The Economist model where they give you some of the editor’s recommendations for free in each issue.  I really loved the reading view and think it would encourage more people to pay up if they could try it out.</p>
<p>I hope more magazines start putting as much thought into their reader and making that reading experience great as the magazine section of The Atlantic does.  The app feels a little disjointed since the experience of the magazine and web content are so different, but I love the content and it’s fantastic to have the option to read both together in one app.  As digital magazines begin to need analytics showing large numbers of both downloads <em>and</em> paid subscribers to sell ads in their iPad editions, I think we’ll see more of this hybrid approach.  Too many magazine apps get downloaded and ignored or deleted because without spending $5 the reader has nothing to engage him or her.</p>

		<p>Having spent the last ten months working on a handful of digital magazine projects, I understand the feeling of fear that builds as you discuss growing your audience on different devices, different platforms, different screen sizes. There are a lot of additional factors beyond this that affect the quality of your publication to new readers.</p>
<p>It might be frightening because your team doesn’t have the skills in-house to build for a new phone OS.  It might make you nervous because you know there’s no money to design and create another version.  It could be scary because your team is small and in the fast-paced world of publishing, they’re already completely overloaded.</p>
<p>But there’s no denying the audiences and the ecosystems of the existing app stores.  You have to go where your customers are, right?</p>
<p>The answer, as always, is, “It depends.”</p>
<p>I was thrilled to see the positive responses the Financial Times received a few weeks ago when they announced their wonderful new web app.  The team behind the FT have mentioned <span class="pullquote">many benefits of their web app, including better relationships with their customers, easier and instantaneous updates, and the ability to do more</span> since they’re only building for one platform versus many.  They have a great, short Q&amp;A on the technical how &amp; why of their new web app here: <a href="http://aboutus.ft.com/2011/06/07/ft-web-app-technical-qa/">http://aboutus.ft.com/2011/06/07/ft-web-app-technical-qa/</a></p>
<p><a title="The new FT app for iPad and iPhone" href="http://app.ft.com/" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Front Page of Financial Times Web App" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FrontPageWebApp1.jpg" alt="Front Page of Financial Times Web App" width="470" height="648" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>WHAT ABOUT VISIBILITY?</p>
<p>Perhaps the Financial Times is able to do this since they already have a large customer base with more than 224,000 paying online subscribers and digital revenue growth last year of 47%.  After only a week of being live, over 100,000 people had accessed the new web app. If you’re a new or small publication, would the same thing work?  Or do new companies need the visibility of the App Store to succeed?</p>
<p>WHAT ABOUT PERFORMANCE?</p>
<p>Another criticism of web app publications is speed.  Apple had updated mobile Safari in iOS 4.3 with the much faster Nitro Javascript engine, however that wasn’t extended to home screen web apps, causing web apps to perform much more slowly than native applications.  This has apparently been addressed in iOS 5 so perhaps that will help alleviate some of the perception that web apps are slow.</p>
<p>HOW DOES IT STACK UP?</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Launch Screen for Financial Times Web App" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LoadingContent1.jpg" alt="Launch Screen for Financial Times Web App" width="347" height="475" border="0" /></p>
<p>It’s slick.  Really slick.  Even launching the app feels native.  Although you can see ads and images download and appear a bit more slowly than text, as you would on a regular browser depending on your connection speed, the entire thing is very responsive.</p>
<p>The first time the web app launches, it asks you to permit it increased storage so it can cache and store offline content.  It explains it very clearly and nothing seemed awkward or confusing.</p>
<p align="center"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Request Database Size Increase" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/RequestToIncreaseDBSize1.jpg" alt="Request Database Size Increase" width="252" height="347" border="0" />   <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Increase Database Size" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IncreaseDBSize1.jpg" alt="Increase Database Size" width="252" height="346" border="0" /></p>
<p>The registration process is very straightforward and fast, and registering allows you to access more articles than the casual viewer.  Without registering, some of the articles are little more than a line or two.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Finished Registration" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/RegistrationDone1.jpg" alt="Finished Registration" width="240" height="343" border="0" />  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Reading Article Not Signed In" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ArticleNotSignedIn1.jpg" alt="Reading Article Not Signed In" width="252" height="346" border="0" /></p>
<p>Articles allow changing of type-size as well as sending the article link via e-mail, Twitter and Facebook.  All three of these things, however, drop you into a new Safari instance instead of using an overlay, which is a little annoying.  However, leaving the app &amp; coming back takes you back to the article you were on, just like native iOS fast-app switching.</p>
<p>After a bit of reading or possibly a network interruption (I’m not entirely clear what triggered it), I received a nice overlay letting me know how to set up offline reading so I can presumably let the web app sync &amp; then read the content offline.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Enable Offline Reading" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/EnableOffline1.jpg" alt="Enable Offline Reading" width="361" height="494" border="0" /></p>
<p>A small section on the front page gives pointers to privacy policy, t&amp;c, feedback link and a profile set-up, which seemed like a strange place for it to go, but maybe they thought since they already had configuration options at the top this would be a bit more clear.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 10px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Feedback, T&amp;C and Privacy Policy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PortfolioFeedbackTAndCPrivacy1.jpg" alt="Feedback, T&amp;C and Privacy Policy" width="349" height="488" border="0" /></p>
<p>The streamed videos were quite nice as they create a nice light box effect which you can enhance by expanding the video to full screen.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Video with UI" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/VideoPlayingWithUI1.jpg" alt="Video with UI" width="197" height="271" border="0" />   <img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Full Screen Video" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FullScreenVideo.jpg" alt="Full Screen Video" width="311" height="243" border="0" /></p>
<p>The advertisements remind me of print magazines.  They show up occasionally and allow you to close them or turn the page when you’re finished.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px auto 6px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Advertisement" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Advertisement1.jpg" alt="Advertisement" width="319" height="438" border="0" /></p>
<p>OVERALL</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Check Out the Web App" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/SwitchToWebApp1.jpg" alt="Check Out the Web App" width="249" height="338" align="right" border="0" />After I finished taking a look at the web app, I launched the native app and thought it was funny to see a message box letting me know I could use their new web app instead.  I find very little difference between the two versions.  The images, ads and videos load slightly faster initially on the native app, but as I mentioned above, perhaps this will become a non-issue when iOS 5 comes around to boost web app speed.</p>
<p>This web app is a huge success and having come from an established publication like the Financial Times, it helps to pave the way for other media channels to avoid the app stores if they want to.  Web apps today may not have all the bells and whistles that native apps can have, but they can certainly deliver a world class title in an intuitive and well-designed way.</p>
<p>For small and new publishers who are scared of Apple’s 30% cut of their already-very-tight margins, it’s a great relief to know there are options available.</p>

		<p>When you live and breathe one industry for most of your professional life, what happens?</p>
<p>Usually you end up living in a bit of a bubble.&nbsp; That bubble is reinforced when your friends, peers and colleagues are in the same industry.&nbsp; This is dangerous because it changes your perception of reality.</p>
<p>I recently moved from being a developer in the tech industry to being a techie in the publishing industry.&nbsp; Here are a few of the many things I have had to learn so far: </p>
<ul>
<li>&#8211; <strong>JUST SHIP IT: </strong>In software development, even when you’re trying to ship a product and the deadline has slipped and it’s massive panic all around, there still comes a time when people staying awake and checking in code does more damage than good.&nbsp; You tell everyone to go home, get some sleep and come back in the morning to finish the work.&nbsp; In publishing, there is no concept of go-home-before-you-do-more-damage.&nbsp; There is only the concept of the publisher’s deadline.&nbsp; Which is gospel.&nbsp; You stay until it’s published. </li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8211; NEW/SHINY == BAD: </strong>In the tech world, you can throw a new system, framework, device or design at people and they’ll intuitively figure out how it works.&nbsp; In the publishing world, people rely a great deal on their systems working the same way.&nbsp; You cannot introduce changes or features without ample training and/or documentation or you risk a massive productivity loss.
<li>&#8211; <strong>MY PHONE ISN’T BROKEN, THE SITE IS: </strong>Techies generally keep their software and devices up-to-date.&nbsp; We’re interested to know if the new features are good, if performance is improved or if security holes are fixed.&nbsp; Outside of the tech world, many people don’t update because they don’t know they can or they don’t know how or, more often, they just don’t care.&nbsp; Telling people to upgrade their iPhone software can come across as an insult instead of the helpful tip you thought it would be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why does any of this matter?</p>
<p align="center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/image.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 6px; display: block; float: none" title="image" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/image_thumb.png" width="183" height="198"></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Living and working inside a bubble helps us to forget who our customers really are.&nbsp; I observed this in my first full-time job working on a brand new development framework at Microsoft (codename Avalon, now WPF).&nbsp; We spent months designing and architecting cool API test harnesses which dynamically integrated all APIs and extrapolated every possible combination of values.&nbsp; It was a tough piece of work but no one else had done it, and we were so proud.</p>
<p>Walking into a meeting with the other 100 people on the team, we sat down ready to hear praise for our unprecedented and forward-thinking accomplishment.&nbsp; Instead, the director got in front of us, said nothing and opened his laptop.&nbsp; He opened Visual Studio, selected “Create new Avalon project” and hit F5 to compile and run.&nbsp; Visual Studio crashed.&nbsp; In all our discussions about ascertaining perfect quality, we hadn’t once thought about who was going to use the framework and what their process would be like. We failed.&nbsp; From then on, at least 50% of my time was spent testing by “using the product as a customer.”&nbsp; We shipped a much better product because of that change.</p>
<p>As G.I. Joe used to say, “Knowing is half the battle.”&nbsp; Knowing you are in a bubble is the first step towards being able to change your behaviour and do the right thing for whoever your customers are.&nbsp; My customers right now are editors, copy chiefs, photography editors and print designers.&nbsp; I still have a lot to learn, but each time I observe their work styles and habits, I can creep a little bit more out of my bubble and build a little bit better software for them to use.</p>

		<p>Funemployment is over.&nbsp; I have work to do.</p>
<p>I made the decision last summer, when I was starting to look at new jobs, that I no longer wanted a full-time, all-consuming job.&nbsp; I made a list of what I wanted, and it looked like this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Time to work on my own projects (2 days a week)<br />&#8211; Time to continue my graduate course work in computational linguistics and data visualisation (1 day a week)<br />&#8211; Working from home<br />&#8211; Working with smart people from whom I can learn loads<br />&#8211; The opportunity to teach others<br />&#8211; Cutting-edge technology<br />&#8211; Work in areas I’m passionate about: media, publishing, mobile, news<br />&#8211; Ability to continue to travel<br />&#8211; Complete ownership of my schedule<br />&#8211; Last but not least: stay in Ireland (at least until my visa runs out!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might be the luckiest person I know – things are working out great so far.&nbsp; Here’s what I’m working on: </p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="National College of Ireland" border="0" alt="National College of Ireland" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image1.png" width="155" height="102"> </p>
<p><strong><u>LECTURING:</u></strong> I have accepted a part-time lecturing position at the <a title="National College of Ireland website" href="http://www.ncirl.ie/" target="_blank">National College of Ireland</a> for the Advanced Rich Internet Applications piece of their new <a title="MSc in Web Technologies program overview" href="http://www.ncirl.ie/Programmes_Courses/Part-time-Courses/MSc-in-Web-Technologies-part-time-MSCWEBTECH1" target="_blank">MSc in Web Technologies program</a>.&nbsp; I start at the end of January, and I can’t express how much I’m looking forward to it.&nbsp; During my time at Microsoft Ireland, my absolute favourite part of my job was being able to take small groups of developers and teach programming concepts and new technology designs.&nbsp; I love teaching, so I can’t wait to get started.</p>
<p><strong><u>PERSONAL PROJECTS:</u></strong> I’m continuing to work on my own projects, which are small prototypes that I will probably blog about later.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Nomad Editions " border="0" alt="Nomad Editions " src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/NomadLogo114.jpg" width="114" height="114"></p>
<p><strong><u>NEW TECHNOLOGY:</u></strong> And lastly but most exciting, I’ve joined the team at <a title="Nomad Editions" href="http://readnomad.com/" target="_blank">Nomad Editions</a> as their tech lead.&nbsp; I can’t think of an area I’m more passionate about right now than digital magazines.&nbsp; I’ve been a magazine junkie my whole life, and what magazines are doing with their digital versions is absolutely breaking my heart.&nbsp; Nomad Editions is a mobile-focused start-up based in New York doing the <strong><em>right</em></strong> thing for magazine and news readers as well as anyone who loves narratives and storytelling.&nbsp; Nomad Editions are small, focused weekly magazines downloaded to your desktop/laptop/phone/tablet/device that look amazing, no matter how you’re reading them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are a foodie, a surfer or a film buff, you can sign up for the free beta trials now at <a href="http://nomadeditions.com/">http://nomadeditions.com</a>.&nbsp; Or follow us on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/readnomad">http://twitter.com/readnomad</a> (each magazine has its own feed as well which I’ve listed here: <a href="http://twitter.com/martharotter/nomadeditions-15">http://twitter.com/martharotter/nomadeditions-15</a>).&nbsp; Working with fantastically smart people like Petr van Blokland, Roger Black, Filipe Fortes and the superstar Nomad team means I’m learning all the time from the best of the best, which is an unbelievable opportunity.</p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Nomad Editions Magazines" border="0" alt="Nomad Editions Magazines" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image2.png" width="483" height="166">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nomad Editions runs on top of Treesaver technology, designed and built by <a title="Filipe Fortes" href="http://fortes.com/" target="_blank">Filipe Fortes</a>.&nbsp; Treesaver is what makes Nomad work cross-browser/cross-platform/cross-device and look amazing the whole time.&nbsp; To learn more about Treesaver, you can <a title="Treesaver on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/trsvr/" target="_blank">follow @trsvr on Twitter</a><font size="3">.&nbsp; This video interview with Robert Scoble gives an excellent overview of Treesaver’s origins and how it works: <a title="Treesaver Shows HTML5 Can Hold its Own Against Flipboard-style Design" href="http://scoble.it/h77h0T">Treesaver Shows HTML5 Can Hold its Own Against Flipboard-style Design</a>.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>So that’s what I’m up to for the next few months.&nbsp; I’ll be in New York city next week for some new Nomad Editions developments and I’ll definitely have some news to blog about after that.</p>

<p><strong><u>Funemployment</u></strong> <em>[fuhn-em-<strong>ploi</strong>-mənt] –noun </em>: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The art of making unemployment fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funemployment took me from my return from Nepal and Tibet through the holiday season &amp; new year.&nbsp; I can’t recommend it enough.&nbsp; Up until this break, I haven’t ever not worked since I was about 16.</p>
<p>You know those projects that build up?&nbsp; Sometimes they’re silly things like organize my desk, get rid of books I don’t read anymore, de-clutter the cupboards, redesign my blog.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Everyone has these.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For me, they’re more often than not along the lines of, “What if my Lego Mindstorms robot could place a beer on my Roomba, and the Roomba could drive it over to me?”&nbsp; or “What if my refrigerator were smart about its inventory and could let me know what I needed to buy and when?” or “What if I could correlate eating certain things to feeling a certain way?”&nbsp; They’re not lifelong quests, usually just short projects.&nbsp; But they are things that a) pile up over time and b) I never have had time for due to having a time-consuming job.</p>
<p>Funemployment, as it turns out, is a great time to take care of those things.</p>
<p>I travelled to Nepal and Tibet, which I’ve already written about, but also to Spain, Paris, New York and home to St. Louis to celebrate Thanksgiving with my family.&nbsp; I worked on three mobile applications I have wanted to build for a long time.&nbsp; I starting creating my own company for contract and consulting work.&nbsp; I streamlined my home office and picked up some new tech and gadgets.&nbsp; I began learning new styles of cooking including Mexican, Southern American, Japanese and slow-cooking.&nbsp; I reorganized closets, recipes, books, CDs, the whole kitchen, and basically the entire house.&nbsp; I went out a lot.&nbsp; I stayed home a lot, too.&nbsp; I spent lots of quality time with family and friends.&nbsp; I became obsessed with my Xbox Kinect and the opportunities it presents.&nbsp; I tried new restaurants and new cafes.&nbsp; I stitched up all my socks with holes in them (I’m very proud of this one).</p>
<p>And I read.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; I constantly tear through magazines, and I found some new ones to fall in love with.&nbsp; During Funemployment I read mostly technology books, but also non-fiction and some good fiction as well.&nbsp; I have a few books I will review on the blog later, but&nbsp; I want to call out one specifically here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594488843" target="_blank">Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</a> by <a title="Daniel H. Pink's website" href="http://www.danpink.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Pink</a>.&nbsp; Having led technology teams before, I was already well aware that money is a poor motivator and that autonomy, trust and respect are much more useful in helping someone develop and produce great work.&nbsp; However, this book goes beyond that, with fascinating real-life examples and insightful ideas to consider in terms of motivating both yourself and your team.&nbsp; A great summary video of the book was done by RSA Animate and <a title="RSA Animate - Drive: The Surprsing Truth About What Motivates Us" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc" target="_blank">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image of Drive book" border="0" alt="image of Drive book" align="right" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image.png" width="156" height="240"></p>
<p>But my favourite takeaway from <em>Drive</em> is a concept called “The Sagmeister.”&nbsp; Pink named the concept after designer Stefan Sagmeister who closes his shop every seven years and takes a 365-day sabbatical.&nbsp; The idea is that since retirement is very far away, wouldn’t it be great to intersperse it with our normal life?&nbsp; Pink writes about Sagmeisters and Stefan’s TED talk <a title="Daniel Pink: Sabbaticals by Sagmeister" href="http://www.danpink.com/archives/2009/07/sabbaticals-by-sagmeister" target="_blank">here on his blog</a>.&nbsp; I read this book during a day-long bus ride from Kathmandu to Pokhara, where we were going to start our trek.&nbsp; At the time, Sagmeisters seemed like a luxurious and frivolous idea.&nbsp; Definitely something that would be impossible to do if you had a career in a fast-paced field like technology.&nbsp; After several long days of hiking and loads of time to think, I concluded it was completely reasonable and probably highly useful.&nbsp; I even calculated how much I’d need to save per month to make this happen five years from now.</p>
<p>Mostly, it made me realize that I, not Stefan Sagmeister, was the crazy one for waiting until now to take some time off.&nbsp; I really treasured those couple of months and highly recommend it to anyone.</p>

		<p>I knew that various parts of the web are blocked inside of China, but I didn’t realize how much it would actually affect me during my five days there.&nbsp; Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TwitPic, Tumblr, Dropbox, Foursquare, Vimeo, various Google services (Calendar, Reader), certain news sites, podcast downloads.&nbsp; All of these things were inaccessible while I was there.&nbsp; I of course tried loads of VPN services and proxy clients but couldn’t get any to connect.</p>
<p>It didn’t stop at the web, though.&nbsp; SMS messages to my family were garbled (this happened to both my friend Karen and me, and we were on different networks: MaxRoam (me) and O2 (Karen), so it didn’t seem to be a carrier issue) or just didn’t make it.&nbsp; I missed loads of incoming SMS messages as well.&nbsp; I can’t explain how frustrating it is to feel completely cut off from your friends and family.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At the Lhasa airport on the way back to Kathmandu, I used Maxroam to call my family and it worked great.&nbsp; I couldn’t wait to get back to Nepal and catch up more with folks.&nbsp; It made me realize that even though I can go weeks without using the web when I want to disconnect, I do miss them when I know they’re there and I can’t get to them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It felt silly, because how much do you really miss when you don’t read Twitter or Facebook for a few days?&nbsp; Usually not terribly much.&nbsp; In fact I rarely use them or any of the other blocked sites I mentioned above when I’m on holidays.&nbsp; But I returned to Kathmandu feeling like I had been in outer space for a year.&nbsp; It’s a very strange feeling.</p>

		<p>Tibet.&nbsp; It’s full of newness, oldness, changingness and strangeness.&nbsp; The one-hour drive from Lhasa airport to the centre of the city of Lhasa feels like something out of <em>The Hills Have Eyes.</em>&nbsp; It’s very barren, very hilly and very brown.&nbsp; We saw the occasional yak or construction work team, but little else.&nbsp; So arriving in shiny, neon-y Lhasa after that feels like you’ve just arrived in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>I won’t write much about Tibet other than to say that I enjoyed Lhasa, but if I were to go back to Tibet I would skip it and go to some of the other Tibetan towns.&nbsp; I’d be happy to talk in person about this varied and rapidly changing city, but it’s quite a sensitive subject for many reasons.&nbsp; Mostly because I’d like to go back some day.&nbsp; So I’m just posting a few pictures here of our visit, and I’ll leave it at that for now.</p>
