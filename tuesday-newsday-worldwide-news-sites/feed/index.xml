					<description><![CDATA[Hi John and thanks for your comment. 

Yes, that is bad design as many people don&#039;t realize they have to specifically go to the &quot;m.&quot; site versus the &quot;www.&quot; site.  It&#039;s an easy thing to detect and fix, too. I hope they will update their site to detect and redirect at some point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Martha,
You did an awful lot of work on those comparisons! 
Oddly enough, I was complaining to someone recently about the Irish Times site and how bad it was on my phone compared to the Guardian and Telegraph out of Britain. I didn&#039;t realize the IT had a mobile-friendly site for phones until I read this article. So a failing of the IT is that the main www site does not check for screen size and render automatically for the phone.
