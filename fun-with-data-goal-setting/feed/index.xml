					<description><![CDATA[It is interesting to see that write a book is te least achieved goal. Do people set up subgoals to assist them with these tasks? For instance, you write there are goals we complete but do view as goals, such as graduating from school or college. These goals are  long commitment and complex to achieve. The reasons why we achieve them are structural. Firstly, society creates a structure where people are required to complete these goals: there are external expectations and supports. Secondly, school and college students are bonded into cohort groups, and the closer these cohorts, and more driven and talented a cohort, the more likely the cohort is to succeed. Finally, these achievements are broken down into small, achievable subgoals, such as complete grade 5, and from that, complete algebra 1, and even more refined than that, complete algebra quiz on  Tuesday.  Do you think that the real problem with large goals is that people do not create the structures necessary to complete them? Ta :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a popular novel writing goal on 43 Things that is often achieved. The wording changes annually and amongst goal setters but it is in effect one goal and that is win NaNoWriMo.  

This stands for National Novel Writing Month and that is November each year.  To win one must complete a 50000 word novel within the month. 

If all the NaNoWriMo goals were combined into one for charting purposes it is likely that goal would be amongst the achieved rather than not achieved goals.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic post!

I can&#039;t believe 30,000 people want to write a book and another 10,000 want to write a novel. Think of all the untapped potential! The empty library shelves!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha, thanks Jodi :)  Glad you enjoyed it, it was really fun to look at the data and find the interesting observations.  Will be helpful for the other project as well, but considering playing with their API to see if I can connect frequency of updates to success rates or something useful like that.]]></description>
