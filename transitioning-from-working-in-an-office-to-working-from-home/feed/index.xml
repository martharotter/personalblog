					<description><![CDATA[Yeh, it can be tough thats for sure. 

I guess if they are really into meeting you they shouldnt mind coming out to Dun Laoghaire, it&#039;s not a million miles away. 

I hardly think you can be so cheeky as to invoice them time for the chat. MAYBE you could if you had to travel out to them, but as I say, getting them to call out your way would work. 

I also try to organise meetings in town to one day, so rather than going in on Weds, and Thurs for 2 separate meetings, try organise them for one day. 

There just my thoughts anyway!]]></description>
