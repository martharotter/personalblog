					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, 

Thanks for your comment - definitely a good point! I think there&#039;s a strong argument for creating incentives around something like this or even building it into the team culture if possible, so that it becomes an additional part of your workflow like writing tests &amp; writing documentation.

It&#039;s definitely not easy to make sure it happens, but as the examples show it&#039;s really worth the effort.

I think you forgot one excuse: The well-meaning individual who agrees with all of what you said but never actually gets around to updating their blog.
