					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tyus, thanks for your comment. I&#039;m not sure how your grids are laid out, but if you want to send me a link to the code I&#039;d be happy to take a look.

Exact image placement is almost impossible to do with Treesaver since it can change so much depending on the user&#039;s device dimensions. There is a github ticket open on this here: https://github.com/treesaver/treesaver/issues/164 if you want to stay up-to-date with the progress on this issue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the information and resource files. I have a question, I notice if I want an image to stay in a specific spot I have to put a div inside the figure tag. What I can&#039;t figure out is once I do that the image will only be one column wide. What am I missing? Thanks in advance]]></description>
