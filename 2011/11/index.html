		<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Quantified Self" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image11.png" alt="Quantified Self" width="449" height="116" border="0" />One of the first things I discovered this past weekend in Amsterdam at the first ever <a title="Quantified Self Europe 2011" href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/Amsterdam-2011/">Quantified Self Europe conference</a> is that I clearly do a bad job explaining what QS is. When asked why I obsessively track things in my life like sleep patterns, exercise habits, food intake, skin condition, and others, I usually give a rambling answer about measuring things to make life better and improve myself and make changes and I like numbers.</p>
<p>Then I’m met with a blank stare which reads, “Freakshow.”</p>
<p>However I spoke with a lot of people this weekend (many of them wearing tracking devices like fitbit &amp; jawbone) who mentioned that when they talk about using RunKeeper or a Withings scale, the response is often “Wow cool, I want to do that too!”</p>
<p>So I’m obviously not a great spokesperson for the movement. However measuring and tracking data about myself is something I’ve been doing ever since I was a little kid, tracking what I spent my babysitting money on and my pet rabbit’s snack intake. I once made a chart extrapolating out all of the possible outfit combinations in my closet (this wasn’t as hard as it might sound, I wore a school uniform during the school year &amp; a camp uniform during the summer, and my mom made the rest of my clothes &#8211; it was slim pickings). I was born a data nerd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS QUANTIFIED SELF?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve already disqualified myself from answering that question, so I’m stealing the definition from the <a title="About Quantified Self" href="http://quantifiedself.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantified Self site</a>: <em>“Quantified Self is a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking. We exchange information about our personal projects, the tools we use, tips we’ve gleaned, lessons we’ve learned.”</em>  There. Make sense?</p>
<p>I discovered QS through two of my heroes:  1) <a title="Seth Roberts' Blog" href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/">a researcher named Seth Roberts</a>, who has been blogging for years about his attempts to improve his lifestyle through self-experimentation and 2) <a title="Feltron.com" href="http://feltron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicholas Felton, creator of the annual Feltron Report</a>, a collection of beautiful graphics illustrating achievements and quantified activities of Felton throughout the year. Both of these individuals inspired me to begin tracking data to find correlations and improve my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I GET THE IDEA, BUT WHAT’S WITH THE MEETUPS?</strong></p>
<p>Quantified Self meetups happen all over the world (<a title="Quantified Self Meetup in Dublin" href="http://www.meetup.com/Quantified-Self-Dublin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and just started in Dublin</a>!). People use them to share what they’ve learned, ask questions and grow together. It’s a community movement of people who want to make their lives and the world around them better.</p>
<p>Show &amp; Tell meetups allow people to discuss things they’re trying, problems they’ve had, get suggestions and then report back on their successes or issues.  The conference is an annual event for both users and those building apps and tools for self-trackers to meet and discuss the needs of the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Quantified Self Europe" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image12.png" alt="Quantified Self Europe" width="334" height="106" border="0" /><strong>QS EUROPE </strong></p>
<p>You know you’re at a Quantified Self meetup when people show up in the morning with kinks in their hair where their <a title="Zeo" href="http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeo band</a> was. I can’t tell you how much I learned from the insightful and forward-thinking people at QS Europe. I am very glad I went. I learned about personal data visualization integration, building tools for others, objective versus subjective tracking, and lots in between. I met many inspiring people and returned to Dublin quite energized and enthusiastic (and with some ideas for my Christmas list this year like the jawbone bracelet tracker!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CURING YOUR SKIN WOES WITH FOOD</strong></p>
<p>The talk I gave was one of the hardest I’ve ever given because it was so personal. I’m very comfortable giving tech talks, discussing APIs and doing programming demonstrations, but I don’t usually talk about personal things.</p>
<p>One’s face is very personal. When I moved to Ireland in 2007, I began to have skin problems. It began gradually and I attributed it to the move, to stress, to late nights drinking with developers and clients, to travel, to whatever excuses I could think of. The stress was multiplied by the anxiety of being embarrassed about how my face looked, but also because my new job in Ireland involved me being on stage in front of large audiences constantly, often several times a week. A year later my skin was perpetually inflamed, red, full of sores and very painful. When one spot would go away, two more would spring up in its place. It was a tough time. I cried a lot.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I went to see my hometown dermatologist while I was home for holidays. <span class="pullquote">He told me that a) this was completely normal and b) there was nothing I could do but go on antibiotics for a year (in addition to spending a fortune on creams and pills). I didn’t believe either of those things.</span></p>
<p>I was not interested in being on an antibiotic for a year, nor was I interested in Accutane (my best friend has had it multiple times and it hasn’t had long term results, plus it can be risky). What I was interested in was figuring out why this was happening and changing my life to make it stop. I refused to accept my dermatologist’s insistence that what you put in your body has no effect on how you look and feel.</p>
<p>I began systematically cutting things out of my diet to see how I reacted. First chicken and soy, based on a recommendation from a food allergist. Over the course of a year I cut out sugar, gluten, carbs, starches, caffeine, meat, fish until finally the magical month of December 2010 when I cut out dairy. My skin was my own again by New Year’s day this year.</p>
<p>It took a year to figure it out. It was completely worth it. There’s nothing wrong with Irish dairy, it just doesn’t work for me. I drink Americanos instead of lattes now, I don’t eat cereal; none of that is a huge deal. For what it’s worth, I can drink goat’s milk.</p>
<p>It was worth it but it was still tough. So I spoke at QS Europe about my journey in the hopes that it can help and inspire others who are embarrassed about their skin condition or scared of long stints of antibiotics or potentially risky treatments like Accutane. My slides, while not very exciting since it was a lot more storytelling than slide showing, are below. If you are going through something similar I encourage you to find a group of kind and helpful people like QS-ers, or use a community forum like <a href="http://curetogether.com/">http://curetogether.com/</a> to help get support and suggestions.</p>

<p>Idea Magazine wants to help.</p>
<p>Today we’re opening up a limited amount of job listings for our inaugural issue launching December 8th. We’re not interested in posting bulk ads with hidden company names.

<p>Our job listings cost only 35 Euros each and are featured in both the website and the magazine itself. This is a great deal as it delivers your ad to a very targeted audience of people interested and working in technology in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>We will be selective about which job listings we post so that a) they’re not overwhelming for the readers and b) your job has a chance to stand out.</p>

		<p>When talking about digital news apps, we often don’t think outside the walls of written content. However radio and audio applications also deliver news, stories and entertainment to large audiences. There are excellent podcasts in almost every category and their popularity is growing constantly.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Audio News Apps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud4.png" alt="Audio News Apps" width="388" height="504" border="0" /></p>
<p>Why would someone choose to listen to audio news instead of reading the same thing, especially when you can probably read faster than most speakers can deliver the same amount of information? Audio news apps are convenient, especially for the increasing number of long-haul commuters. Audio apps let you multi-task (which is arguably a good thing). Listening to a discussion on a topic may be more insightful than an article with one person’s point of view. Maybe our eyes get tired of looking at screens all day. And sometimes it’s nice to listen to well-spoken people with pleasant voices.</p>
<p>I fell in love with Audible a couple of years ago. They have a great selection of books and reasonably priced membership. But two things really sold me: 1) the convenience of being able to drop them onto my mp3 player and listen during commutes and travel and 2) the wonderful readers.  Reading a David Sedaris book is always entertaining. Listening to David Sedaris read you his book, while doing impressions of his sisters and his father, is like stand-up comedy. Malcolm Gladwell’s books become somehow more insightful when read by his calm and thoughtful voice.</p>
<p>So I have a thing for voices. Anyway, back to the apps and their popularity. Today we’ll be covering iPad audio news apps Stitcher, NPR, and RTÉ Radio News.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STITCHER<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Stitcher Radio" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud1.png" alt="Stitcher Radio" width="327" height="424" border="0" /></strong></p>
<p>I learned about Stitcher a while back when I first found the TechCrunch Headlines podcast (which Stitcher produces).  Stitcher is an app for streaming podcasts, radio and news to mobile devices including iPhone, Android, iPad, BlackBerry and Palm. The app has a catalogue of various podcasts and channels both on demand and live which users can subscribe to for free.</p>
<p>Opening Stitcher shows a nice, simple layout with some of the top news stories, popular channels and new additions on the right and basic navigation on the left.  Clicking into a podcast or channel starts it playing immediately.  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Stitcher Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud6.png" alt="Stitcher Front Page" width="315" height="409" border="0" /></p>
<p>For navigation, the user can choose between OnDemand or Live Stations. Once the user has found a podcast he likes, he can click the star icon to add it to the list of Favorites. Favorites stitches together playlists so users can simply click on Favorites and hear a stream of interesting content.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Stitcher Favorites View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud8.png" alt="Stitcher Favorites View" width="457" height="372" border="0" /></p>
<p>Individual episodes can also be bookmarked, to save or listen later. The Favorites list refreshes the podcasts every so often to make sure the episodes are the most recent ones.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Stitcher Favorites View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud7.png" alt="Stitcher Favorites View" width="464" height="373" border="0" /></p>
<p>Stitcher has done three things very, very well. First of all, they have tons of content. By region, by interest, by source, they have created a very good directory of much of the top audio content available. Next they created native apps for multiple platforms. So you can listen on many devices and get the same great experience. Lastly they have kept the interface very clean and simple. There aren’t any instruction pages here, no one needs them. The audio controls are always at the top, the navigation always on the left, and the playlist or podcast detail always on the right. Very easy-to-use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NPR<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR iPad App" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud21.png" alt="NPR iPad App" width="361" height="469" border="0" /></strong></p>
<p><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR, or National Public Radio</a>, is a familiar enough name to most radio fans. They have built a large audience for their popular shows like Radiolab, All Things Considered, Planet Money, On The Media and many more. NPR’s programming reaches a weekly audience of 26+ million listeners, so they’re clearly creating desirable and interesting content.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud22.png" alt="NPR Front Page" width="384" height="498" border="0" /></p>
<p>NPR has done a fantastic thing by creating their <a title="Programmable Web :: COPE: Create Once, Publish Everywhere" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/10/13/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere) system</a> which allows other people to build on top of them and access their content. This means that there are many different people and organizations pushing NPR’s content out for them, spreading the audio and podcasts to various devices and platforms.  They’re a very creative organization when it comes to their technology, and their iPad app, which was recently updated for iOS 5, is no exception.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR Article View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud12.png" alt="NPR Article View" width="450" height="362" border="0" /></p>
<p>When you launch the NPR iPad app, you have a lovely, easy-to-use interface showing you a selection of recordings and news with a radio player/navigation control section at the bottom. To move between the different channels, there is a sort-of Flud-like, horizontal scroll with thumbnails and short descriptions. For each item, you can choose to listen now or add it to your playlist.</p>
<p>If there are particular programs you regularly enjoy from NPR, you can find them by clicking on the “Programs” button at the bottom and search by title or topic. Clicking the heart icon adds it to your favorites on the left-hand column.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR Catalogue" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud15.png" alt="NPR Catalogue" width="445" height="358" border="0" /></p>
<p>Clicking on an individual podcast starts it playing in the radio player at the bottom of the app. You can alternately add it to your playlist &amp; queue up several podcasts. Some of the news stories have written content you can read and share, some only audio and no metadata. But the navigation controls are relatively easy to use to find the programs you want and listen live or on-demand.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR Audio Ad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud14.png" alt="NPR Audio Ad" width="444" height="357" border="0" /></p>
<p>NPR has an interesting advertising model as well – they intersperse occasional audio ads in between programs or before certain programs.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR No Geolocation" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud16.png" alt="NPR No Geolocation" width="456" height="367" border="0" /></p>
<p>The only thing that doesn’t work outside the US is the station finder. As it uses zip code look up, it can’t find anything near you if you’re outside of the US. I’ve seen this as a problem in many US-centric apps; for a long time trying to use geolocation on The Daily would simply crash the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RTÉ RADIO PLAYER<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Radio Player" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud20.png" alt="RTE Radio Player" width="434" height="349" border="0" /></strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to find a general “audio news” app that isn’t either full of content specific to the producer (like NPR) or more of an aggregator (like Stitcher). The RTÉ Radio Player is an example of a “local news channel” app. Wherever you live, it’s possible that a local media outlet is doing something similar and providing streaming, podcast feeds or an app for you to listen live or catch up on local news.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud24.png" alt="RTE Front Page" width="434" height="349" border="0" /></p>
<p>Upon opening the RTÉ Radio Player (which is landscape view only), the live radio begins playing immediately. It starts in RTÉ Radio 1 streaming the live radio station.  Underneath a small summary of the current playing program is a tabbed interface where users can select the schedule, website or podcasts. There’s currently an ad to the left which, if you click it, takes you to Safari and then immediately the App Store to download the same application again for some reason.  But maybe it’s a rotating ad and I just caught it on a bug.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Schedule Listing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud25.png" alt="RTE Schedule Listing" width="425" height="342" border="0" /></p>
<p>The schedule link is a bit off-putting as it appears as though you could click on one of the programs and start listening to it, but it’s just a static listing of the programs for that channel. Clicking back from the current day takes you to next week’s programs, so there’s no way to look at the schedule from the previous day.  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Website View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud29.png" alt="RTE Website View" width="417" height="335" border="0" /></p>
<p>The website tab simply embeds the RTE website into a small view. You can increase the area by clicking the up arrow icon on the right and navigate around the website, but as it’s full-sized and contains flash ads, it’s a little bit shoe-horned in. It would be much more useful if it were streamlined content or maybe a mobile device-friendly version of the site.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Podcast Listing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud30.png" alt="RTE Podcast Listing" width="428" height="344" border="0" /></p>
<p>On the podcasts tab, you can select from things like most popular, most recent or recommended and you can also search. While you’re presented with only the last day or two worth of podcasts, you can search and find much older recordings if you’re looking for a specific broadcast. I did find it strange that while the podcasts on most popular and most recent seemed to play correctly, clicking on recommended podcasts didn’t always play the podcast I clicked on. I am wondering if it has to do with them being listed but not yet uploaded for that day maybe?<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Channel Selection" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud26.png" alt="RTE Channel Selection" width="449" height="361" border="0" /></p>
<p>To get back to live radio you can click the “Back to Live Radio” button in the top right, which turns into a “Change Station” option when you’re listening to the live radio channel. So you can select that and switch from RTÉ Radio 1 to RTÉ 2fm, RTE Choice, etc. When you change channels, the schedule and website tabs will update but the Podcasts always contain a variety from RTÉ Radio 1, RTÉ 2fm &amp; RTÉ Raidió Na Gaeltachta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>If you travel a lot or spend a lot of time already in front of bright screens, audio news may be a great option for you. Alternately it’s an excellent source of entertainment and education. Whether you decide to go with an aggregator or a local news outlet application depends a lot on the type of content you prefer to hear. Think about your preferences and give one of the audio news apps a shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PODCAST RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>As a podcast enthusiast, I listen to quite a few different podcasts (mostly technology). These days I primarily use Stitcher on my iPad, but I also use <a title="Zune.net" href="http://zune.net/">Zune software</a> (yes, still) to sync my mp3 player and listen on my desktop computer. Anything to keep me away from trying to use iTunes for podcasts, which I think is a miserable piece of software.</p>

<p>For a place with such an amazing tech community of developers, designers, startups, entrepreneurs and just plain “do-ers”, it’s shockingly hard to know what’s going on all the time with the Irish technology scene. The most effective way to find out about interesting startups, new technologies, cool design studios, great places to work, upcoming events, testing techniques, great new fonts, etc. is usually an impromptu meetup with a fellow geek.</p>
<p>When I moved to Dublin four-and-a-half years ago I spent a lot of money on technology magazines, from Ireland and abroad, to find out what was going on (still do – I am a magazine junkie). Foreign magazines always had cool profiles of interesting people, tutorials on things that are new and might be useful techniques, list of stuff that was going on and things to get involved with.</p>
<p>I rarely read about anything interesting happening in Ireland.<strong> &lt;sadFace/&gt;</strong></p>
<p>But at the same time, I was constantly blown away by unique companies being created here. Things like <a title="Build" href="http://2011.buildconf.com/">Build</a> (happening this week in Belfast for the third year!), <a title="Coder Dojo" href="http://coderdojo.com/">Coder Dojo</a> (happening every weekend now!), <a title="24theWeb" href="http://24theweb.com/">24theWeb</a> (2nd annual event happened a couple of weeks ago!), that are all creative and beautifully executed initiatives. Studios that turn out gorgeous websites and mobile applications. People turning industries on their heads.</p>
<p><strong><em>AUGH! AREN’T YOU SO FREAKING PROUD OF IT ALL?! </em></strong></p>
<p>But there’s no platform for talking about it yet. Existing publications write about global gadgets &amp; popular “apps you need now!” They cover huge sales deals. They publish bland PR for big brands. It’s time for something new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>A common trait of successful online news and magazine sites is, surprisingly, a developer blog. Think of a developer blog as a look into the minds of the people building the site: what limitations they have, what they’re working on, what they believe their readers want or need, success stories of how they built interesting things, and even day-to-day tidbits that remind readers that the site is built by thinking, feeling people instead of a faceless entity.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve heard many excuses for not wanting to have a developer blog:<br />
<em>“Who would update the thing? Our team is busy!”<br />
<em>“</em>No one wants to read stuff like this, they want to read the news.”<br />
<em>“</em>We absolutely cannot publish this information, it’s secret. What if someone were to copy us?!”<br />
<em>“</em>We’re developers, not writers. We wouldn’t know what to say.”<br />
<em>“</em>Taking the time to write blog posts takes us away from being able to build the technology our team needs.”<br />
</em>The list goes on and on.</li>
</ul>
<p>But for teams who do make the effort to create and update developer blogs, the rewards are great. I’m going to walk through some of the benefits of creating a developer blog for your site, using excellent existing blogs as examples of how to do this well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p>I believe very strongly that the best way to learn something yourself is to teach others and share your knowledge. This has become apparent to me from many directions including mentoring, teaching, writing tutorials, giving talks and training others. I always learn more each time I share with others.</p>
<p>This industry moves so quickly. Suggestions on things that work and things that don’t as well as best practices and “how to” articles are invaluable for people. A solid “why we did it this way” or “the fastest way to do x” type of article can save other developers a great deal of time and make them eternally grateful to you.  Google recently changed their Maps API Terms of Service, causing a lot of confusion. <a title="Madison.com Labs :: Data-journo-hacker-mappers navigate through the changes to the Google Maps API" href="http://labs.madison.com/blog/2011/10/data-journo-hacker-mappers-navigate-through-the-changes-to-the-google-maps-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Keller from Madison.com wrote about the change</a>s and narrowed down the important bits for others affected by the change.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Madison.com Labs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image.png" alt="Madison.com Labs" width="560" height="581" border="0" /></p>
<p>At <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>, the team is not just interested in educating itself and its blog readers, but also the community. <a title="Chicago Tribune News Apps Blog :: Steal this code" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/10/19/steal-this-code-presentation-to-hackshackers-opengovchicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Germuska blogs about his presentation to Hacks/Hackers Chicago in October</a>, posting his slides and sites he referenced throughout his talk.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Chicago Tribune News Apps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image1.png" alt="Chicago Tribune News Apps" width="540" height="538" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ADVERTISE TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN LICENSE / SELL / GIVE AWAY</strong></p>
<p>It might not happen all the time, but occasionally your team may create new applications or methods of doing things which are so valuable they’re worth selling or licensing. In 2005, <em>The Lawrence Journal-World</em> newspaper from Kansas released an open source tool called the Django web framework, and they ended up spinning out a software division to sell their customized CMS now called <a title="Ellington CMS" href="http://www.ellingtoncms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellington CMS</a>. A CMS coming from a media organization is a huge deal, since every media team I talk to vehemently hates their CMS.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Ellington CMS" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image2.png" alt="Ellington CMS" width="560" height="510" border="0" /></p>
<p>The ProPublica News Apps team released a new feature earlier this month called <a title="DocDiver :: ProPublica" href="http://projects.propublica.org/docdiver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DocDiver</a>, and they <a title="Introducing DocDiver :: ProPublica Nerd Blog" href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/introducing-docdiver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced this on their “ProPublica Nerd Blog</a>.” The blog post included how it works, why they built it, and nerdy details on how it works. The project was built on top of the NYT DocumentViewer app and expands on that open source project.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="ProPublica Nerd Blog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image3.png" alt="ProPublica Nerd Blog" width="560" height="558" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KUDOS AND RECOGNITION FOR YOUR TEAM MEMBERS</strong></p>
<p>Recognition and respect are two of the most important things you can help your team members achieve. <span class="pullquote">Developers and technologists who feel appreciated are more likely to stick around, work harder and be more loyal employees</span>. Industry recognition for your team circles back to help your organization improve its image as well.</p>
<p><em>The Chicago Tribune</em> has built a <a title="Chicago Tribune :: Github projects" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/09/02/show-your-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large collection of applications on Github</a> which are available for others to view &amp; fork: <a href="https://github.com/newsapps">https://github.com/newsapps</a>.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Chicago Tribune News Apps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image4.png" alt="Chicago Tribune News Apps" width="560" height="562" border="0" /></p>
<p>Last week, <a title="Poynter.org :: 6 reasons journalists should 'show your work' while learning &amp; creating" href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/150243/6-reasons-journalists-should-show-your-work-while-learning-creating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poynter.org published an article by Matt Thompson on why journalists should be ‘showing their work’</a> while they create and learn. He mentions paying it forward, building data literacy, increasing the impact of your work and more.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Poynter.org" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image5.png" alt="Poynter.org" width="560" height="544" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GETTING TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO </strong></p>
<p>The worst thing that can happen to an industry is that it stagnates and no innovation occurs. Developer blogs are the perfect way to share your disruptive ideas with others who might be interested in doing something similar or building off of your idea.</p>
<p>My favourite example of this this year is from a Maine newspaper, <em><a title="The Bangor Daily News" href="http://bangordailynews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Bangor Daily News</a>. </em>Tired of a typically clunky workflow which involved a lot of cutting-and-pasting, the team built a new workflow out of Google Docs and WordPress. <em>The Bangor Daily News</em> dev blog is here: <a href="http://dev.bangordailynews.com/">http://dev.bangordailynews.com/</a>.  You can read more about their new workflow here: <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/how-to-run-a-news-site-and-newspaper-using-wordpress-and-google-docs_b4781">http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/how-to-run-a-news-site-and-newspaper-using-wordpress-and-google-docs_b4781</a>.<br />
<strong>BUILD A COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>What if you had a whole community of individuals you could get to give you input, suggestions, or even build things with your data and resources? Think of how much more you could achieve.</p>
<p><em>The Guardian’</em>s Data Blog has done exactly that. A very active blog, The Guardian Data Blog releases new sets of data constantly in raw form. Sometimes they’ve been able to build charts or interactions to tell a story with it, and sometimes they simply provide the data. At the end of each article, they ask “Can you do something with this data?” and ask people to contact them or post visualizations on their Flickr page.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The Guardian Data Blog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image6.png" alt="The Guardian Data Blog" width="560" height="583" border="0" /></p>
<p>The result is a fascinating body of work, which is much more diverse having community input, and is definitely larger than what <em>The Guardian</em> could have produced on its own. That kind of interaction and dedication by a community makes your site and publication much more interesting and valuable.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The Guardian Data Blog Flickr Pool" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image7.png" alt="The Guardian Data Blog Flickr Pool" width="560" height="630" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SHOW OFF YOUR CRAZY IDEAS</strong></p>
<p>My dad used to tell me, “It ain’t bragging if you’ve done it.” If your team has built something amazing, solved a really tough problem, or tried something crazy (even if it was a colossal failure!), why not tell the world? <em>The New York Times</em> launched its “beta620” labs project this year, and the site is specifically for trying out wacky ideas and experimenting. So far they have created some projects which are simply experiments they’ve learned from. But they’ve also created products like the Times Skimmer, which end up as full-fledged products in the main site or in their mobile apps.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The New York Times beta620" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image8.png" alt="The New York Times beta620" width="540" height="515" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HIRE BETTER EMPLOYEES</strong></p>
<p>We all know hiring good developers, designers, UX designers, content strategists and other technology positions is tough and getting tougher. People want to work for respected organizations doing interesting things. Advertising for free on your developer blog that you’re using new technology or being creative is a wonderful way to help the right people find their way to you.</p>
<p>At <em>The Guardian,</em> they have been hosting “<a title="The Guardian Dev Blog : Guardian Hack Day One" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/oct/20/guardian-hack-day-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guardian Hack Days</a>” and “<a title="Guardian Developer Blog :: Developer drop-ins" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/jul/11/developer-drop-in-speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer drop-ins</a>” this year, both of which help expose their team and technology to potentially excellent candidates for future hiring. A developer looking for his or her next role would find articles like these very telling about office culture, priorities and work ethic, all things which are near impossible to discover in an interview.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The Guardian Dev Blog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image9.png" alt="The Guardian Dev Blog" width="560" height="558" border="0" /></p>
