		<p>Data journalism, news apps, open government data. In this age of Anonymous, Wikileaks, and proactive sources publishing freely available data, it is becoming critical that we have journalists and developers working together to make sense of it all and understand how it affects us.</p>
<p>Today there are a growing number of news outlets doing a fantastic job of both publishing data and creating interactions and visualizations to make sense of it. I wanted to showcase a handful of those sites so that people can understand why this type of journalism is important and how it works. And maybe even how to get involved if it’s of interest to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DATA SET PROVIDERS:</strong></p>
<p>There is no shortage of people providing data sets today, the only thing to learn is how to narrow it down to the most useful one for you.</p>
<p>Fingal Open Data is doing a nice job in Ireland encouraging councils to open up their data. Their site <a href="http://data.fingal.ie/">http://data.fingal.ie/</a> provides data in CSV, XML and KML formats, and they’re currently <a title="apps4fingal" href="http://data.fingal.ie/Apps4Fingal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running a competition</a> for people to build useful apps given the available data.</p>
<p>Additionally in Ireland, sites like <a title="The Story: In Search of Transparency" href="http://thestory.ie/">Gavin Sheridan’s The Story</a> and <a title="KildareStreet.com" href="http://www.kildarestreet.com/">John Handelaar’s Kildare Street</a> are excellent resources for presenting data but also learning more about the types of data available in Ireland</p>
<p>I mentioned <a title="The Guardian's Data Blog" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Guardian’s</em> Data Blog</a> in <a title="Tuesday Newsday: Newspaper Developer Blogs" href="http://martharotter.com/blog/index.php/2011/11/tuesday-newsday-newspaper-developer-blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent post about news developer blogs</a> as a great example of community building. But clearly it is also one of the best sources in the UK for a wide range of freely available data sets. For each set of data they post, they offer a download of the data and recommend that if you do anything with it, you post it to their Flickr group. They often have additional visualizations and comparisons as well.</p>
<p><a title="The Guardian Data Blog: Who works the longest hours in Europe" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/dec/08/europe-working-hours" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Example of data provided by The Guardian Data Blog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image.png" alt="Example of data provided by The Guardian Data Blog" width="448" height="595" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are loads of additional resources for finding data, the trick is knowing how to search for the information you need. Sites like ScraperWiki (<a href="https://scraperwiki.com/">https://scraperwiki.com/</a>), DataSift (<a href="http://datasift.com/">http://datasift.com/</a>), The World Bank (<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">http://data.worldbank.org/</a>),   BuzzData (<a href="http://buzzdata.com/">http://buzzdata.com/</a>) and more sites are growing and becoming available to the public for research and data mining.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NEWS APP EXAMPLES: </strong></p>
<p><span class="pullquote">It’s no coincidence that a lot of my news app examples have shown up in prior blog posts – there are some organizations who are very seriously ahead of the pack in terms of understanding how news and technology work together</span>. On one hand I am delighted to have bright minds like these folks paving the way! On the other hand, it makes me a little depressed when I realize that Ireland is nowhere near this level of thinking.</p>
<p>NPR’s StateImpact (<a href="http://stateimpact.npr.org/">http://stateimpact.npr.org/</a>) is a collaboration among NPR and local public radio stations in eight pilot states to examine public policy issues in depth. They provide explanatory, data-driven stories focused on how people’s lives are affected by government decisions.</p>
<p><a title="NPR's StateImpact" href="http://http://stateimpact.npr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR's StateImpact" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image1.png" alt="NPR's StateImpact" width="504" height="392" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The New York Times definitely has a well-respected team of interactive news developers and infographic designers. However it’s not always very easy to find them on their site. The <a title="NY Times Multimedia/Photos page" href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/multimedia/index.html">Multimedia page</a> is the best resource I’ve found for taking a look at cool interactive apps and images they create, but Small labs Inc has also put together a nice collection here: <a href="http://www.smallmeans.com/new-york-times-infographics/">http://www.smallmeans.com/new-york-times-infographics/</a></p>
<p><a title="NY Times Multimedia / Photos page" href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/multimedia/index.html"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NY Times Multimedia / Photos page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image2.png" alt="NY Times Multimedia / Photos page" width="519" height="489" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune has some of the busiest &amp; best news app builders in the United States today and they are constantly kicking out new, interesting information in nice visual formats. Check out their site which has apps in many areas including community, schools, business, politics and more.</p>
<p><a title="Chicago Tribune Maps &amp; Apps" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/data/"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Chicago Tribune Maps &amp; Apps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image3.png" alt="Chicago Tribune Maps &amp; Apps" width="504" height="425" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.propublica.org/tools">ProPublica</a></strong> creates not only fantastic interactive news applications like Dollars for Docs (which I referenced in my Quantified Self talk on skin problems), they also create excellent reusable tools like DocDiver that allow readers to work with the ProPublica reporters.</p>
<p><a title="ProPublica Tools &amp; Data" href="http://www.propublica.org/tools/"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="ProPublica Tools &amp; Data" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image4.png" alt="ProPublica Tools &amp; Data" width="520" height="321" border="0" /></a></p>

<p><strong>DATA JOURNALISM RESOURCES: </strong></p>
<p>To learn more about data journalism, here are a few useful sites to check out and blogs to follow:</p>
<p><a title="The Data Journalism Handbook" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18YOaGj0LyRn6x1tcCH2wIWHYqwnMiDCGInbVHe210rM/edit?authkey=CLrotIQH&amp;hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CLrotIQH&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Data Journalism Handbook</a>: a work-in-progress coordinated by the European Journalism Centre &amp; the Open Knowledge Foundation launched at the Mozilla Festival in London on November 5th 2011.</p>
<p>Data Journalism Blog: <a href="http://www.datajournalismblog.com/">http://www.datajournalismblog.com/</a></p>

<p>ProPublica’s Dan Nguyen’s Scraping for Journalism: A Guide for Collecting Data <a href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/doc-dollars-guides-collecting-the-data">http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/doc-dollars-guides-collecting-the-data</a> – a great introduction to how to grab data that is in maybe less-than-optimal formats.</p>
<p>Also from Dan Nguyen, The Bastards Book of Ruby <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/">http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/</a> – an introduction to programming and its practical uses for journalists, researchers, scientists, analysts and anyone else who needs to make sense of data.</p>
<p>At the Society of News Design conference earlier this year, <a title="SND STL Review" href="http://martharotter.com/blog/index.php/2011/10/snd-stl-review-part-two/">I went to some excellent talks</a> by newsroom app developers who recommended that if you are thinking of going into this area, you need to know either Ruby on Rails or Django/Python, as those seem to be the dominant requested skills for news apps. I also liked this article recently on Poynter about using Backbone to create data news apps: <a href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/147605/how-journalists-can-use-backbone-to-create-data-driven-projects/">http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/147605/how-journalists-can-use-backbone-to-create-data-driven-projects/</a>. You don’t need to know everything, just pick one and start creating projects.</p>

<p>And lastly, from the perfect timing department, here’s Matt Stiles, who is a data journalist from NPR, talking very recently about best practices in building news apps:</p>

		<p>When talking about digital news apps, we often don’t think outside the walls of written content. However radio and audio applications also deliver news, stories and entertainment to large audiences. There are excellent podcasts in almost every category and their popularity is growing constantly.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Audio News Apps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud4.png" alt="Audio News Apps" width="388" height="504" border="0" /></p>
<p>Why would someone choose to listen to audio news instead of reading the same thing, especially when you can probably read faster than most speakers can deliver the same amount of information? Audio news apps are convenient, especially for the increasing number of long-haul commuters. Audio apps let you multi-task (which is arguably a good thing). Listening to a discussion on a topic may be more insightful than an article with one person’s point of view. Maybe our eyes get tired of looking at screens all day. And sometimes it’s nice to listen to well-spoken people with pleasant voices.</p>
<p>I fell in love with Audible a couple of years ago. They have a great selection of books and reasonably priced membership. But two things really sold me: 1) the convenience of being able to drop them onto my mp3 player and listen during commutes and travel and 2) the wonderful readers.  Reading a David Sedaris book is always entertaining. Listening to David Sedaris read you his book, while doing impressions of his sisters and his father, is like stand-up comedy. Malcolm Gladwell’s books become somehow more insightful when read by his calm and thoughtful voice.</p>
<p>So I have a thing for voices. Anyway, back to the apps and their popularity. Today we’ll be covering iPad audio news apps Stitcher, NPR, and RTÉ Radio News.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STITCHER<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Stitcher Radio" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud1.png" alt="Stitcher Radio" width="327" height="424" border="0" /></strong></p>
<p>I learned about Stitcher a while back when I first found the TechCrunch Headlines podcast (which Stitcher produces).  Stitcher is an app for streaming podcasts, radio and news to mobile devices including iPhone, Android, iPad, BlackBerry and Palm. The app has a catalogue of various podcasts and channels both on demand and live which users can subscribe to for free.</p>
<p>Opening Stitcher shows a nice, simple layout with some of the top news stories, popular channels and new additions on the right and basic navigation on the left.  Clicking into a podcast or channel starts it playing immediately.  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Stitcher Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud6.png" alt="Stitcher Front Page" width="315" height="409" border="0" /></p>
<p>For navigation, the user can choose between OnDemand or Live Stations. Once the user has found a podcast he likes, he can click the star icon to add it to the list of Favorites. Favorites stitches together playlists so users can simply click on Favorites and hear a stream of interesting content.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Stitcher Favorites View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud8.png" alt="Stitcher Favorites View" width="457" height="372" border="0" /></p>
<p>Individual episodes can also be bookmarked, to save or listen later. The Favorites list refreshes the podcasts every so often to make sure the episodes are the most recent ones.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Stitcher Favorites View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud7.png" alt="Stitcher Favorites View" width="464" height="373" border="0" /></p>
<p>Stitcher has done three things very, very well. First of all, they have tons of content. By region, by interest, by source, they have created a very good directory of much of the top audio content available. Next they created native apps for multiple platforms. So you can listen on many devices and get the same great experience. Lastly they have kept the interface very clean and simple. There aren’t any instruction pages here, no one needs them. The audio controls are always at the top, the navigation always on the left, and the playlist or podcast detail always on the right. Very easy-to-use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NPR<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR iPad App" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud21.png" alt="NPR iPad App" width="361" height="469" border="0" /></strong></p>
<p><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR, or National Public Radio</a>, is a familiar enough name to most radio fans. They have built a large audience for their popular shows like Radiolab, All Things Considered, Planet Money, On The Media and many more. NPR’s programming reaches a weekly audience of 26+ million listeners, so they’re clearly creating desirable and interesting content.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud22.png" alt="NPR Front Page" width="384" height="498" border="0" /></p>
<p>NPR has done a fantastic thing by creating their <a title="Programmable Web :: COPE: Create Once, Publish Everywhere" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/10/13/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere) system</a> which allows other people to build on top of them and access their content. This means that there are many different people and organizations pushing NPR’s content out for them, spreading the audio and podcasts to various devices and platforms.  They’re a very creative organization when it comes to their technology, and their iPad app, which was recently updated for iOS 5, is no exception.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR Article View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud12.png" alt="NPR Article View" width="450" height="362" border="0" /></p>
<p>When you launch the NPR iPad app, you have a lovely, easy-to-use interface showing you a selection of recordings and news with a radio player/navigation control section at the bottom. To move between the different channels, there is a sort-of Flud-like, horizontal scroll with thumbnails and short descriptions. For each item, you can choose to listen now or add it to your playlist.</p>
<p>If there are particular programs you regularly enjoy from NPR, you can find them by clicking on the “Programs” button at the bottom and search by title or topic. Clicking the heart icon adds it to your favorites on the left-hand column.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR Catalogue" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud15.png" alt="NPR Catalogue" width="445" height="358" border="0" /></p>
<p>Clicking on an individual podcast starts it playing in the radio player at the bottom of the app. You can alternately add it to your playlist &amp; queue up several podcasts. Some of the news stories have written content you can read and share, some only audio and no metadata. But the navigation controls are relatively easy to use to find the programs you want and listen live or on-demand.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR Audio Ad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud14.png" alt="NPR Audio Ad" width="444" height="357" border="0" /></p>
<p>NPR has an interesting advertising model as well – they intersperse occasional audio ads in between programs or before certain programs.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="NPR No Geolocation" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud16.png" alt="NPR No Geolocation" width="456" height="367" border="0" /></p>
<p>The only thing that doesn’t work outside the US is the station finder. As it uses zip code look up, it can’t find anything near you if you’re outside of the US. I’ve seen this as a problem in many US-centric apps; for a long time trying to use geolocation on The Daily would simply crash the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RTÉ RADIO PLAYER<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Radio Player" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud20.png" alt="RTE Radio Player" width="434" height="349" border="0" /></strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to find a general “audio news” app that isn’t either full of content specific to the producer (like NPR) or more of an aggregator (like Stitcher). The RTÉ Radio Player is an example of a “local news channel” app. Wherever you live, it’s possible that a local media outlet is doing something similar and providing streaming, podcast feeds or an app for you to listen live or catch up on local news.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud24.png" alt="RTE Front Page" width="434" height="349" border="0" /></p>
<p>Upon opening the RTÉ Radio Player (which is landscape view only), the live radio begins playing immediately. It starts in RTÉ Radio 1 streaming the live radio station.  Underneath a small summary of the current playing program is a tabbed interface where users can select the schedule, website or podcasts. There’s currently an ad to the left which, if you click it, takes you to Safari and then immediately the App Store to download the same application again for some reason.  But maybe it’s a rotating ad and I just caught it on a bug.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Schedule Listing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud25.png" alt="RTE Schedule Listing" width="425" height="342" border="0" /></p>
<p>The schedule link is a bit off-putting as it appears as though you could click on one of the programs and start listening to it, but it’s just a static listing of the programs for that channel. Clicking back from the current day takes you to next week’s programs, so there’s no way to look at the schedule from the previous day.  <img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Website View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud29.png" alt="RTE Website View" width="417" height="335" border="0" /></p>
<p>The website tab simply embeds the RTE website into a small view. You can increase the area by clicking the up arrow icon on the right and navigate around the website, but as it’s full-sized and contains flash ads, it’s a little bit shoe-horned in. It would be much more useful if it were streamlined content or maybe a mobile device-friendly version of the site.<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Podcast Listing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud30.png" alt="RTE Podcast Listing" width="428" height="344" border="0" /></p>
<p>On the podcasts tab, you can select from things like most popular, most recent or recommended and you can also search. While you’re presented with only the last day or two worth of podcasts, you can search and find much older recordings if you’re looking for a specific broadcast. I did find it strange that while the podcasts on most popular and most recent seemed to play correctly, clicking on recommended podcasts didn’t always play the podcast I clicked on. I am wondering if it has to do with them being listed but not yet uploaded for that day maybe?<img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="RTE Channel Selection" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/TuesAud26.png" alt="RTE Channel Selection" width="449" height="361" border="0" /></p>
<p>To get back to live radio you can click the “Back to Live Radio” button in the top right, which turns into a “Change Station” option when you’re listening to the live radio channel. So you can select that and switch from RTÉ Radio 1 to RTÉ 2fm, RTE Choice, etc. When you change channels, the schedule and website tabs will update but the Podcasts always contain a variety from RTÉ Radio 1, RTÉ 2fm &amp; RTÉ Raidió Na Gaeltachta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>If you travel a lot or spend a lot of time already in front of bright screens, audio news may be a great option for you. Alternately it’s an excellent source of entertainment and education. Whether you decide to go with an aggregator or a local news outlet application depends a lot on the type of content you prefer to hear. Think about your preferences and give one of the audio news apps a shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PODCAST RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>As a podcast enthusiast, I listen to quite a few different podcasts (mostly technology). These days I primarily use Stitcher on my iPad, but I also use <a title="Zune.net" href="http://zune.net/">Zune software</a> (yes, still) to sync my mp3 player and listen on my desktop computer. Anything to keep me away from trying to use iTunes for podcasts, which I think is a miserable piece of software.</p>

		<p>A common trait of successful online news and magazine sites is, surprisingly, a developer blog. Think of a developer blog as a look into the minds of the people building the site: what limitations they have, what they’re working on, what they believe their readers want or need, success stories of how they built interesting things, and even day-to-day tidbits that remind readers that the site is built by thinking, feeling people instead of a faceless entity.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve heard many excuses for not wanting to have a developer blog:<br />
<em>“Who would update the thing? Our team is busy!”<br />
<em>“</em>No one wants to read stuff like this, they want to read the news.”<br />
<em>“</em>We absolutely cannot publish this information, it’s secret. What if someone were to copy us?!”<br />
<em>“</em>We’re developers, not writers. We wouldn’t know what to say.”<br />
<em>“</em>Taking the time to write blog posts takes us away from being able to build the technology our team needs.”<br />
</em>The list goes on and on.</li>
</ul>
<p>But for teams who do make the effort to create and update developer blogs, the rewards are great. I’m going to walk through some of the benefits of creating a developer blog for your site, using excellent existing blogs as examples of how to do this well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p>I believe very strongly that the best way to learn something yourself is to teach others and share your knowledge. This has become apparent to me from many directions including mentoring, teaching, writing tutorials, giving talks and training others. I always learn more each time I share with others.</p>
<p>This industry moves so quickly. Suggestions on things that work and things that don’t as well as best practices and “how to” articles are invaluable for people. A solid “why we did it this way” or “the fastest way to do x” type of article can save other developers a great deal of time and make them eternally grateful to you.  Google recently changed their Maps API Terms of Service, causing a lot of confusion. <a title="Madison.com Labs :: Data-journo-hacker-mappers navigate through the changes to the Google Maps API" href="http://labs.madison.com/blog/2011/10/data-journo-hacker-mappers-navigate-through-the-changes-to-the-google-maps-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Keller from Madison.com wrote about the change</a>s and narrowed down the important bits for others affected by the change.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Madison.com Labs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image.png" alt="Madison.com Labs" width="560" height="581" border="0" /></p>
<p>At <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>, the team is not just interested in educating itself and its blog readers, but also the community. <a title="Chicago Tribune News Apps Blog :: Steal this code" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/10/19/steal-this-code-presentation-to-hackshackers-opengovchicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Germuska blogs about his presentation to Hacks/Hackers Chicago in October</a>, posting his slides and sites he referenced throughout his talk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ADVERTISE TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN LICENSE / SELL / GIVE AWAY</strong></p>
<p>It might not happen all the time, but occasionally your team may create new applications or methods of doing things which are so valuable they’re worth selling or licensing. In 2005, <em>The Lawrence Journal-World</em> newspaper from Kansas released an open source tool called the Django web framework, and they ended up spinning out a software division to sell their customized CMS now called <a title="Ellington CMS" href="http://www.ellingtoncms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellington CMS</a>. A CMS coming from a media organization is a huge deal, since every media team I talk to vehemently hates their CMS.</p>

<p>The ProPublica News Apps team released a new feature earlier this month called <a title="DocDiver :: ProPublica" href="http://projects.propublica.org/docdiver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DocDiver</a>, and they <a title="Introducing DocDiver :: ProPublica Nerd Blog" href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/introducing-docdiver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced this on their “ProPublica Nerd Blog</a>.” The blog post included how it works, why they built it, and nerdy details on how it works. The project was built on top of the NYT DocumentViewer app and expands on that open source project.</p>

<p><strong>KUDOS AND RECOGNITION FOR YOUR TEAM MEMBERS</strong></p>
<p>Recognition and respect are two of the most important things you can help your team members achieve. <span class="pullquote">Developers and technologists who feel appreciated are more likely to stick around, work harder and be more loyal employees</span>. Industry recognition for your team circles back to help your organization improve its image as well.</p>

<p><strong>GETTING TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO </strong></p>
<p>The worst thing that can happen to an industry is that it stagnates and no innovation occurs. Developer blogs are the perfect way to share your disruptive ideas with others who might be interested in doing something similar or building off of your idea.</p>
<p>My favourite example of this this year is from a Maine newspaper, <em><a title="The Bangor Daily News" href="http://bangordailynews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Bangor Daily News</a>. </em>Tired of a typically clunky workflow which involved a lot of cutting-and-pasting, the team built a new workflow out of Google Docs and WordPress. <em>The Bangor Daily News</em> dev blog is here: <a href="http://dev.bangordailynews.com/">http://dev.bangordailynews.com/</a>.  You can read more about their new workflow here: <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/how-to-run-a-news-site-and-newspaper-using-wordpress-and-google-docs_b4781">http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/how-to-run-a-news-site-and-newspaper-using-wordpress-and-google-docs_b4781</a>.<br />
<strong>BUILD A COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>What if you had a whole community of individuals you could get to give you input, suggestions, or even build things with your data and resources? Think of how much more you could achieve.</p>
<p><em>The Guardian’</em>s Data Blog has done exactly that. A very active blog, The Guardian Data Blog releases new sets of data constantly in raw form. Sometimes they’ve been able to build charts or interactions to tell a story with it, and sometimes they simply provide the data. At the end of each article, they ask “Can you do something with this data?” and ask people to contact them or post visualizations on their Flickr page.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The Guardian Data Blog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image6.png" alt="The Guardian Data Blog" width="560" height="583" border="0" /></p>
<p>The result is a fascinating body of work, which is much more diverse having community input, and is definitely larger than what <em>The Guardian</em> could have produced on its own. That kind of interaction and dedication by a community makes your site and publication much more interesting and valuable.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The Guardian Data Blog Flickr Pool" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image7.png" alt="The Guardian Data Blog Flickr Pool" width="560" height="630" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SHOW OFF YOUR CRAZY IDEAS</strong></p>
<p>My dad used to tell me, “It ain’t bragging if you’ve done it.” If your team has built something amazing, solved a really tough problem, or tried something crazy (even if it was a colossal failure!), why not tell the world? <em>The New York Times</em> launched its “beta620” labs project this year, and the site is specifically for trying out wacky ideas and experimenting. So far they have created some projects which are simply experiments they’ve learned from. But they’ve also created products like the Times Skimmer, which end up as full-fledged products in the main site or in their mobile apps.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The New York Times beta620" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image8.png" alt="The New York Times beta620" width="540" height="515" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HIRE BETTER EMPLOYEES</strong></p>
<p>We all know hiring good developers, designers, UX designers, content strategists and other technology positions is tough and getting tougher. People want to work for respected organizations doing interesting things. Advertising for free on your developer blog that you’re using new technology or being creative is a wonderful way to help the right people find their way to you.</p>
<p>At <em>The Guardian,</em> they have been hosting “<a title="The Guardian Dev Blog : Guardian Hack Day One" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/oct/20/guardian-hack-day-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guardian Hack Days</a>” and “<a title="Guardian Developer Blog :: Developer drop-ins" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/jul/11/developer-drop-in-speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer drop-ins</a>” this year, both of which help expose their team and technology to potentially excellent candidates for future hiring. A developer looking for his or her next role would find articles like these very telling about office culture, priorities and work ethic, all things which are near impossible to discover in an interview.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The Guardian Dev Blog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image9.png" alt="The Guardian Dev Blog" width="560" height="558" border="0" /></p>

		<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Facebook News Apps" border="0" alt="Facebook News Apps" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image32.png" width="458" height="193">In the last month we’ve had some news sources trying an unconventional method of reaching new audiences: Facebook. “Go where your readers live” is the message of news applications within Facebook, and there is certainly no shortage of people who spend a significant amount of time checking in on Facebook throughout the day, whether it is to update their own account or to see what’s going on with their friends and other businesses/events they follow.&nbsp; Today we’re looking at a few of these Facebook-integrated news apps, including WSJ Social by the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post Social Reader, and The Guardian on Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHY INSIDE OF FACEBOOK?</strong></p>
<p>For companies who need advertising revenue and care deeply about page impressions, length-of-time-on-site and other metrics to share with their advertisers, going to an external site and creating a [free] presence there seems like an odd strategy. But there are a few things Facebook offers companies who want to build a reader on top of their platform. First of all, regarding ad revenue, all is not lost. Facebook can sell ad positions around the app just like any of their other content or pages. However any ads appearing inside the app itself are revenue for the app creators. Secondly, the sharing and social nature of Facebook allows extra, free publicity. Readers can easily share and recommend articles to their friends who may not be regular readers of the publication and may take an interest, check out the article, subscribe, etc. Basically Facebook provides a large population of actively sharing, potential readers.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote">And news sites need to care about where their readers are. <a title="Nielsen report on Americans Time Online" href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/145736/americans-spend-just-a-fraction-of-online-time-with-news-compared-to-social-media/" target="_blank">Nielsen published a report in September showing where Americans spend their time online</a>. While social network sites like Facebook checked in at 22.5%, reading current events and global news was a paltry 2.6% of overall Internet time.</span></p>
<p>Subscription costs and pay walls are still important revenue concepts for news sites. While all of the apps discussed below are free, it remains to be seen if they all stay that way. The WSJ Social indicates on their site that <a title="WSJ :: Help &amp; Information Center - WSJ Social" href="http://help.wsj.com/help/tools-and-formats/wsj-social/" target="_blank">content is currently free for an undisclosed limited time, courtesy of their launch sponsor</a> (Dell).&nbsp; As all three apps have links on each article to view it on the original site, I’m not sure what happens if you do that and run into a pay wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="WSJ Social" href="http://apps.facebook.com/wsjsocial" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 6px" title="WSJ Social on Facebook" alt="WSJ Social on Facebook" src="http://cl.ly/070c1r3k361b1G1J092S/Image_2011.10.25_17_19_31.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>WSJ SOCIAL</strong></p>
<p><a title="WSJ Social on Facebook" href="https://apps.facebook.com/wsjsocial" target="_blank">WSJ Social</a> launched about a month ago, right before Facebook’s developer conference F8. Unlike other Facebook news apps like The Washington Post Social Reader, The WSJ Social was a Wall Street Journal-only project, not initiated or otherwise influenced by Facebook itself. The Wall Street Journal have made all content from wsj.com available on WSJ Social, which is surprising to some, considering their pay wall and subscription charges.</p>
<p>Clicking on the WSJ Social app takes you to a Flipboard-style grid layout of articles, showing titles, images, icons of friends who may have read the article, and comment / like counts. On the left you have a column of your “Top Editors.” Clicking on the Help &amp; Information Center tells you that in WSJ Social, you and your friends are editors, and your top editors can be anyone you have chosen to add to your editor list, whether or not they are your Facebook friends. Clicking the plus and minus buttons adds and removes editors, respectively.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 6px" title="WSJ Social : Article View" alt="WSJ Social : Article View" src="http://cl.ly/0u1U3z3H1E3X3S2K100T/Image_2011.10.25_20_05_09.png"></p>
<p>The article view is quite similar to the regular web view, albeit a little less cluttered. It’s a cleaner feel, and a distinct lack of “What’s popular today” and “Most discussed articles” type of content blocks. You’ll see comments left by other Facebook users, and have the opportunity to post comments to both the article and your own Facebook feed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Washington Post Social Reader" href="http://apps.facebook.com/wpsocialreader" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 6px" title="Washington Post Social Reader on Facebook" alt="Washington Post Social Reader on Facebook" src="http://cl.ly/150O2R1m0A0R1b1t190V/Image_2011.10.25_18_12_31.png" width="631" height="660"></a></p>
<p><strong>THE WASHINGTON POST SOCIAL READER</strong></p>
<p><a title="Washington Post Social Reader on Facebook" href="http://apps.facebook.com/wpsocialreader" target="_blank">The Washington Post Social Reader</a> pulls its stories both from its&nbsp; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">http://www.washingtonpost.com</a> front page as well as its content partners including The Associated Press, Reuters, Mashable, GlobalPost, etc. Every person will see something different on the front page of the app, as the stories shown reflect a user’s profile and likes as well as stories read and liked by friends.</p>
<p>The top of the app is comfortable to read, showing a headline story and two other top stories. What follows are two columns of article headlines, images and short descriptions, along with the article source and timestamp. They show a small box on the right of trending stories, and on the left they show a column featuring what friends are reading or have read. This column, powered by Trove, feels redundant, because at the same time you have Facebook’s column on the far right telling you what your friends are doing with apps right at this moment.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 6px" title="Washington Post Social Reader : Article View" alt="Washington Post Social Reader : Article View" src="http://cl.ly/1E0y1z241C0c2k2n0C2A/Image_2011.10.25_20_02_44.png"></p>
<p>Viewing articles is a similar experience to reading articles with the WSJ Social. The article is generally a cleaner version of the one on their site and has less distractions, advertisements and unrelated content boxes. You can leave comments on the article and your own Facebook wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="The Guardian on Facebook" href="http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 6px" title="The Guardian on Facebook" alt="The Guardian on Facebook" src="http://cl.ly/302d111C1W0k1j1u390j/Image_2011.10.25_19_50_59.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>THE GUARDIAN ON FACEBOOK</strong></p>
<p>The Guardian is no stranger to new and interesting approaches to sharing their content. Their app, which has the most users of the three, is a very different style and looks more like it is actually part of Facebook, possibly due to the colours and fonts used.</p>
<p><a title="The Guardian on Facebook" href="http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian" target="_blank">The Guardian on Facebook</a> features an activity stream like the Washington Post Social Reader, showing what your friends have read recently. It has a 3-column box showing popular content right now, and a grid below of larger images showing articles people are commenting on most recently. Underneath that is an additional grid of latest features and links to other Guardian Facebook pages.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 6px" title="The Guardian on Facebook : Article View" alt="The Guardian on Facebook : Article View" src="http://cl.ly/0N3A4346372t013A2h0x/Image_2011.10.25_19_59_26.png"></p>
<p>Article views are again cleaner. They show links to other stories in the same category, followed by options to comment, recommend or alternately post your comment on The Guardian’s external site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SIMILAR TO MOBILE </strong><strong>FIRST APPROACH</strong></p>
<p>All three of these sites were able to reduce the amount of content shown to improve the usability of their Facebook app. Which leads me to believe they did some examining of what people are actually clicking and reading and what people value on the external sites. This is the same thing that Luke W talks about in <a title="Luke W :: Mobile First presentation" href="http://www.lukew.com/presos/preso.asp?26" target="_blank">his excellent “Mobile First” talk</a>, this idea that if we take out all of these things that aren’t the priority and are left with something great, doesn’t that tell us something? Constraints force people to prioritize, and prioritizing your users means making a smaller set of more popular features better to use.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen Luke’s presentation, you should both <a title="A Book Apart :: Mobile First by Luke Wroblewski" href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first" target="_blank">buy his book which just came out</a> and <a title="Luke W :: Mobile First slides" href="http://www.lukew.com/presos/preso.asp?26" target="_blank">take a look at his Mobile First presentation slides</a>, specifically the section about “Constraints = Focus.”</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I was able to view the apps fine from the browser on my iPad (not iPhone or Windows Phone 7&nbsp; though), but none of them show up in the “Apps” view on the Facebook mobile apps for iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ARE PEOPLE USING THEM?</strong></p>

<p>The Guardian reported their millionth Facebook app sign up over the last week and seems to be growing steadily. The Washington Post Social Reader and the WSJ Social, on the other hand, have a bit of a ways to go. </p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Michael Donohoe :: WP Social" border="0" alt="Michael Donohoe :: WP Social" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image36.png" width="540" height="236"></p>
<p>Not every Facebook user is happy with the idea of sharing every article he or she reads, nor do friends necessarily want to see your detailing each story read. Privacy and tedium are both concerns here. <a title="Michael Donohoe :: WP Social Reader" href="http://donohoe.tumblr.com/post/10683087630/wp-social-reader" target="_blank">Michael Donohoe has a great post here</a> about what happens when your friends notice you are reading certain things.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Facebook App Settings" border="0" alt="Facebook App Settings" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image37.png" width="540" height="331">As with many Facebook-related things, there are privacy controls so that users can block their friends seeing certain activities or stop an app from posting to their timeline, but they may not be incredibly obvious or easy to locate/use. It might be hours after your profile has shown that you’ve read a controversial article that you realize it was there, as it’s not always obvious what gets posted to your profile and what doesn’t. By that time, conservative colleagues will have already seen it. It depends how careful you are about locking down your Facebook profile and whether you care about others knowing what you’re reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY </strong></p>
<p>Facebook’s huge push at F8 of both their Social Graph and news apps using Facebook mean we will see more and more of these types of apps, especially from media and news companies looking for new audiences. It will be interesting to see statistics on whether the “likes” and application users convert into subscriptions and/or traffic for the sites themselves. In the meantime I’d like to ask the news sites to consider that if the apps are in fact working well, maybe it’s worth taking some of the minimized design from the apps back to their own sites to see if it makes a difference.</p>

Now that iOS5 is live, it’s time to give it a test drive and see if it meets publishers’ expectations.</p>
<p><a title="Apple :: Features that go further" href="http://www.apple.com/ios/features.html" target="_blank">Apple describes Newsstand</a> as “A custom newsstand for all your subscriptions.” Newsstand is more of a wood panel folder than an app on your device. Opening Newsstand on your device will reveal any magazine or newspaper apps you have downloaded. Alerts should tell you when new issues arrive, and a blue banner should go across issues you haven’t yet read. New covers should automatically update in the background. This hasn’t been the case for me, however, my covers only seem to update when I launch the title, prompting a new download and a cover update.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/newsstandLandscape.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsstand on iPad" border="0" alt="Newsstand on iPad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/newsstandLandscape_thumb.png" width="540" height="434"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED COVERS</strong></p>
<p>As I mention above, my covers aren’t updating in the background by themselves (maybe it’s a first-gen iPad thing?). But there is something very nice about giving publishers the freedom to not be restricted to a square icon for their cover. Magazines and newspapers each have a very different feel for their cover pages, so I love how, for example, <em>Once Magazine</em>’s cover shows up in landscape mode, <em>The New York Times</em> looks like a NYT cover, and <em>National Geographic</em> has its own familiar branding.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/newstandPortrait.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsstand on iPad" border="0" alt="Newsstand on iPad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/newstandPortrait_thumb.png" width="408" height="530"></a></p>
<p>It feels a little weird that tapping that cover, for many magazines (not for news apps like <em>The Daily</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>), takes you not directly into the issue you just clicked, but rather into the magazine’s app where you can purchase or download more titles. I ran into a lot of crashing bugs as I was reviewing and problems where every time I opened the app I had to re-download the current issue. I’m hoping these will get sorted out soon.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/netMagStoreLandscape.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Inside a magazine's app" border="0" alt="Inside a magazine's app" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/netMagStoreLandscape_thumb.png" width="501" height="403"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO I ADD NEW MAGAZINES OR NEWSPAPERS?</strong></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/AppStoreLandscape.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsstand in the App Store" border="0" alt="Newsstand in the App Store" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/AppStoreLandscape_thumb.png" width="518" height="421"></a>Don’t yet have anything in your newsstand? You can get new magazines and newspapers by clicking the small “Store” button when you open the Newsstand folder, or you can visit the App Store. You can click on Categories-&gt;Newsstand or click the giant Newsstand banner on the front page to see all of your choices.&nbsp; Selection isn’t amazing just yet, but it’s new so I imagine a lot of publishers are still finalizing and testing their apps. You can get the bigger, hyped apps like <em>The Daily</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Guardian, Reader’s Digest</em> and other titles. More will trickle in every week.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/appstoreLandscape1.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsstand in the App Store" border="0" alt="Newsstand in the App Store" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/appstoreLandscape1_thumb.png" width="532" height="428"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT’S IN A NAME?</strong></p>
<p>Newsstand strikes me as an odd name for this. Newsstands in airports and train stations are always bad news for my wallet. I constantly find new titles, spot an eye-catching headline and buy magazines I haven’t heard of. My iPad Newsstand, however, is a small collection of stuff I already have spent money on. There isn’t any serendipitous finding of exciting new authors or insights. It’s subtle, but this is more like my bedside table or magazine rack in my office. A newsstand, to me, is an exciting place with opportunities for discovery (and, as I mentioned, dropping lots of cash).<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/whereIsEverythingLandscape.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Genius for Newsstand? Why Not?" border="0" alt="Genius for Newsstand? Why Not?" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/whereIsEverythingLandscape_thumb.png" width="507" height="412"></a></p>
<p><span class="pullquote">What would be more interesting for me (and cause me to spend more money) would be if there were an element of “You liked reading <em>The New York Times</em> recently, why not try<em> The Guardian</em> for iPad?”, ala Amazon recommendations</span>. Maybe each time I open up the Newsstand there are suggestions or notices about new titles or new issues. Right now it’s cumbersome and when I do make the effort, there just really isn’t that much I want to read.&nbsp; So perhaps as new titles are added to the collection it will improve. I will wait and see. I do think they’re missing a trick by making it a good five or six clicks to find something new to buy, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SHOW ME THE NUMBERS</strong></p>
<p>It’s barely a week old, so it seems a bit early to expect that Newsstand presence would make a dent in anyone’s numbers. At the same time, I mentioned there aren’t many folks there so early adopters always have an advantage of more eyeballs sooner.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I notice I see barely anything in the Newsstand Store on my iPad and iPhone, maybe 20 titles max. But if I look at Newsstand on iTunes on my desktop, it lists many more titles. Perhaps there’s some admin work happening to make more things visible in the device stores soon.</p>
<p>Future Publishing seems to be happy with the numbers so far anyway. They <a title="Association of Online Publishers :: Future Racks up more than 2m Apple Newsstand downloads in 4 days" href="http://www.ukaop.org.uk/news/future-publishing-2million-apple-newsstand-downloads3056.html" target="_blank">launched more than 50 titles last week</a> and have seen more than two million downloads in the four days they’ve been live. </p>
<p>There are plenty of app store analytics services you can use to track opens, downloads, subscriptions. I don’t know if any of these have been enhanced (or shut down) with the launch of Newsstand, so I will take a look and find out. A huge downside to publishers using the App Store is the lack of information about subscribers and customers. If Apple doesn’t assist with this problem, there will likely be more publishers going the way of the Financial Times and building web apps to maintain better relationships with their audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO GET MORE READERS</strong></p>
<p>One of the toughest things for consumers reading magazines on an iPad is knowing whether they’re actually going to enjoy reading it or whether they’ll look at it once, find it awkward or unusable, and never open it again. A great editorial team also requires a great tech team to make it work. An excellent idea which many successful titles do is a free sample download so you can understand their app and content. <em>Wired</em> does, <em>National Geographic</em> does, Project does, and hopefully most news and magazine apps will move in this direction soon.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/onceMagStoreLandscape.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Once Magazine Sample Issue" border="0" alt="Once Magazine Sample Issue" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/onceMagStoreLandscape_thumb.png" width="484" height="389"></a></p>
<p>Another thing to consider is offering less choices. In a project I worked on recently, we had a lot of discussions about price points. We ended up with two options, a monthly and an annual subscription. A surprisingly high number of people opted immediately for the cheaper-in-the-long-run annual subscription. The more choices you offer the more you will confuse your customer, so pick one or two good value options and stick with them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The best thing about Newsstand for publishers is that it puts a reminder on the screen of every iOS device to read, subscribe, check out news and magazines. There are a lot more optimizations Apple can and should make to help publishers sell more subscriptions such as recommendations and a “genius” type of search tool in the Newsstand section of the App Store. With numbers like Future has reported, good things are in store for publishers using Newsstand.</p>

		<p>We’ve looked at a lot of digital versions of their newspaper counterparts. Today instead we’re looking at news sources providing their content only online and not through any print formats.&nbsp; I’m examining digital-only news sources The Daily, Newsy and New360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Daily Splash Screen" border="0" alt="The Daily Splash Screen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-11-10-2011-15-58-26.png" width="322" height="436">THE DAILY</strong></p>
<p>I was very excited for The Daily when it was announced. The first iPad-only news source, backed by Rupert Murdoch, the first Apple-endorsed app to use the new App Store subscription model – it seemed like this was going to change the way that people viewed digital news and open the door for paid subscriptions to news and magazine apps which at the time were struggling to find consumers willing to purchase digital subscriptions. And they needed paying subscribers (<a title="The Daily on iPad: 500,000 Readers a Day to Break Even" href="http://www.digitalversus.com/daily-ipad-500-000-readers-day-break-even-news-17876.html" target="_blank">500,000 to be more precise</a>): they have a large team and their own reporters/journalists so the content is original.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Daily: Welcome Back Screen" border="0" alt="The Daily: Welcome Back Screen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-11-10-2011-16-00-05.png" width="391" height="530">But the app was very heavy. The early versions crashed frequently and took a long time to download each day’s edition. There were bugs. It was slow. It crashed when it tried to detect my location (since I am outside the US). Every few days, the app would forget that I had a paid subscription &amp; require me to sign up again, causing me to fear I was being charged multiple times. Eventually that annoyance and the focus on US news (there is still very little world news coverage except for very big stories) caused me to cancel my subscription.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Daily: Front Page" border="0" alt="The Daily: Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-11-10-2011-16-02-36.png" width="361" height="489">At SND last week, I learned that The Daily has a team of 50 designers to help lay out each day’s issue by hand, 100 pages in total. And then they do it again in landscape mode. They have no automatic templates. They use Adobe tools the whole way through up until they need to put it into the CMS and then rebuild it there. To me, this whole process sounds like a nightmare. An unsustainable one at that. </p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Daily: Interactive Page" border="0" alt="The Daily: Interactive Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-12-45-39.png" width="352" height="477">But the pro of this painful process is that The Daily has absolute freedom to design however they want, something most publishers can’t do from either a financial or labour perspective. They can use things like Jamie Beck’s cinemagraphs. They can hand-code HTML5 animations and transitions when they run into CMS limitations. They have freedom to design and customize everything each day. That’s pretty amazing, and something I think a lot of publishers would appreciate, especially given that at every event I’ve been to this year, CMSs have been cited as painful and limiting software.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Daily: Carousel View" border="0" alt="The Daily: Carousel View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-12-19-00.png" width="346" height="469"></p>
<p>With their creativity and design freedom, The Daily designers have experimented with many interesting ideas. They have a carousel of image pages to use for navigation, or you can use the navigation links at the bottom. They now do a brief video report for each edition describing the day’s stories. They have cool interactive features in certain articles allowing the user to play or respond to a survey or guess trivia. There’s a scroll bar at the top to move quickly around the issue and see thumbnails of stories.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Daily Page Navigation View" border="0" alt="The Daily Page Navigation View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-13-56-56.png" width="320" height="434">The Daily reported last week that <a title="The Guardian :: Rupert Murdoch's The Daily has 80,000 Paying Subscribers" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/03/rupert-murdoch-daily-subscribers" target="_blank">they have 80,000 paying subscribers</a>. Although it’s not even 20% of what they will need to eventually break even, it’s still an impressive number, especially given that they launched only back in February. Perhaps they will streamline design to save money or perhaps the increase in iPad sales will spur further growth for them. For me, it’s an impressive design but not content I’m interested in. Plus it still crashes a lot for me.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Daily: Article View" border="0" alt="The Daily: Article View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-12-18-18.png" width="359" height="487"></p>
<p>Someone at SND (I think Josh Clark?) that there could be room for a model where people select and pay for the news they want. If this were the case, I might opt to pay for the arts, tech and news sections. At least let me save the room on my iPad memory? <span class="pullquote">After all, why force users to wait for the celebrity gossip section and sports section to download when they never intend to read those?</span> It could be an interesting model to consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsy Splash Screen" border="0" alt="Newsy Splash Screen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-12-55-21.png" width="356" height="483">NEWSY</strong></p>
<p>The novel idea about <a title="Newsy" href="/tag/newspapers/www.newsy.com" target="_blank">Newsy</a> is that it is video-only news. I couldn’t verify with certainty that it is the first video-only news site or app, but it’s the first one I have heard about. Newsy is multi-source and multi-platform, and it claims it is the only video news service that allows users to compare bias by highlighting nuances in reporting.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsy app versions" border="0" alt="Newsy app versions" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image22.png" width="186" height="329">Newsy currently works on iPhone, iPad, Android, and Blackberry. Plus their website has all of their content as well.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsy Website Front Page" border="0" alt="Newsy Website Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image23.png" width="506" height="434"></p>
<p>How does Newsy work? Newsy takes various reports on the same subject, from sources like MSNBC, ABC, The Huffington Post, The Daily Beast, etc., and produces short, professional video clips highlighting common and disparate views from the various channels. They provide additional context and conveniently merged video clips. Sources for each story are noted at the top of each video page.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsy Video Report" border="0" alt="Newsy Video Report" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image24.png" width="362" height="493">Stories featured on Newsy come from their rotating editorial team, who research blogs, news sites, magazines, television and many other sources. They have their own technology which can record as they do their research to help them put together the whole story when they feel they have a comprehensive, bias-free view.&nbsp; Viewers are invited to comment on stories and contribute as well.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Newsy iPad App Main Page" border="0" alt="Newsy iPad App Main Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-12-55-43.png" width="399" height="541">Newsy is a refreshing look at world, US, political, business, tech, entertainment, science and sports news without a bias or an agenda. There are ads on their apps and website, but other than that I’m not sure what their revenue model is. They have been winning awards and getting great reviews, so I’m sure we’ll continue to see them do interesting things.</p>

<p><strong><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="news360 Splash Screen" border="0" alt="news360 Splash Screen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-11-10-2011-19-23-54.png" width="335" height="454">NEWS360</strong></p>
<p>If The Daily is the first iPad-only news and Newsy is the first video-only news, News360 has to be the first semantic analysis news. While it sounds similar, it is actually quite different to something like Zite or News.me. It’s hard to explain without using it. <img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="news360 Account Creation" border="0" alt="news360 Account Creation" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-11-10-2011-19-26-39.png" width="302" height="409"></p>
<p>News360 takes information from your social profiles, generates what it thinks are your interests (although you have a lot of granular control over this &amp; can edit it further), and then provides you with a giant feed of stories it thinks are interesting for you. The difference between this and something like Zite is that it collects various sources for the same story and lets you read the version you want (or all of them). </p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="news360 Article View" border="0" alt="news360 Article View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-13-26-46.png" width="238" height="331">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="news360 Original Article View" border="0" alt="news360 Original Article View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-13-26-39.png" width="241" height="331"></p>
<p>For example, if I am reading about Steve Yegge’s Google+ post, I get options to read the version from the International Business Times, The Register, Forbes.com, Wired News and 38 additional sources for this story. Whew! Also interesting is that I get the abbreviated text in a nice, easy-to-read format, but I can see the original as well by pulling up the source page below. I also get buttons for sharing the article on any of seven social networks as well as highlighting the common text for this article.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="news360 Sharing Options" border="0" alt="news360 Sharing Options" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-13-10-2011-13-27-05.png" width="263" height="357">There’s some weirdness in News360. Why do I need a URL to access my stories? Why does it need permission to post to my Twitter feed? Does it actually get value from analysing my Evernote account? Does this process really “save hours of my life?”</p>

<p>But despite the long set-up time and confusing options, New360 provides a lot of news sources and a lot of articles relevant to a user’s interests. If you’re a news nut and find yourself visiting lots of sites over the course of a day and re-reading the same articles, this app may help you focus on the unique stories and then read the version that suits you (or all of them, if you need more info), ignoring a lot of duplication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The doom and gloom we keep hearing from the print media industry is definitely depressing. I recently went to see Page One: Inside the New York Times and found the idea that people might stop paying for investigative journalism very scary. At the same time it is wonderful to see creative minds building apps like these to try to find new models of generating revenue for news and information.&nbsp; I also love that there is a focus on getting the story from several angles so as to remove bias and get the most correct version. I realize this cannot happen without either exclusive contracts or lack of pay wall, however, so that is a challenge. It will definitely be interesting to see these apps continue to grow.</p>

<p><strong>CONFERENCE DAY 2</strong></p>
<p>The second day of SND STL had me overwhelmed. I listened to so many great speakers the previous day, learned so much, saw so many excellent demos. And now here I was with another great line-up of sessions to choose from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Tweet" border="0" alt="Tweet" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image15.png" width="540" height="88"><strong>Cross-Platform Editing</strong> – Teresa Schmedding is the president of the American Copy Editors Society and also an assistant managing editor at the Daily Herald in Chicago. Teresa talked about trying to hold the line between editorial quality and actually getting stuff out the door. Her stories of pet peeves of writers and editors she’s dealt with were highly entertaining. It’s hard to know what’s worth fighting for. You will have readers who will write and complain about certain edits so you have to know what your standards are.</p>
<p>As someone who finds it near impossible to read blogs, websites, even Twitter feeds, and of course books and print media, with bad grammar and spelling, I sympathize with these tough calls. I know carelessness can lose you readers. </p>
<p>Teresa’s top recommendations were three things: <br />1) Focus on grammar, it’s the most important <br />2) Details: make sure you’ve got ‘em and they’re consistent<br />and<br />3) Structure: make sure it’s not confusing for the reader</p>
<p>Teresa recommended not to spend time on some of your old and time-consuming style rules, certain old “newspaper” rules, and your boss’s pet peeves. Ask people, your readers, what they value so you can ensure you’re spending time on what’s most important to your readers.&nbsp; And if you’re thinking about a pay wall, people will not pay for error-filled copy whether they are grammatical, spelling, or fact errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Tweet" border="0" alt="Tweet" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image16.png" width="540" height="92"><strong>Designing a Responsive News Website</strong> – Everyone working on the web at this point has to have seen the Boston Globe redesign at <a href="http://bostonglobe.com/">http://bostonglobe.com</a>.&nbsp; Miranda Mulligan and Mat Marquis are two of the main folks behind the redesign. They talked very honestly about what went into the redesign, what was hard, what was valuable and what pieces they’re still working on. They described HTML5 &amp; Responsive Design and which pieces they wanted to incorporate in their new site. They also showed us the grids they ended up using and how they worked with things like Scott Jehl’s Responsive Images script, media queries and other technology to make it work right.</p>
<p>Challenges they came across included the Boston Globe masthead (very complicated &amp; went through many revisions), third party integration for things like video and advertising, making HTML5 crossword puzzles (this piece is currently in beta), saving offline stories, and interactive information graphics in responsive sites.</p>
<p>Also interesting to me was that they chose a new CMS and went with <a href="http://www.eidosmedia.com/">http://www.eidosmedia.com</a> which is also used by the Denver Post, the New York Post and the Washington Post.&nbsp; It will take two years to implement and customize, print products will launch on it next year.</p>
<p>Lastly they covered the importance of using analytics and allowing them to inform future decisions such as grid widths.&nbsp; Excellent and candid talk about the real pain and equally real rewards of going through this process.</p>
<p><a title="Is HTML5 Responsive Design by @yurivictor" href="http://twitpic.com/6thfr4" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 6px" src="https://dn3pm25xmtlyu.cloudfront.net/photos/large/412319488.png?Expires=1535214485&#038;Signature=dQzc97yyBjLpEdXBE3Cdrphczn8cNqnYYjLBXONsem8sWImyM0NH9Q3I-mor23~bXnn2egkqJtnQbvL5Po~vQBmBYXO6o-SNEBpp-WNiDyjSwXwNWqsPowt6YRJ-wf6jQ7mGcR0u4z7FRNcjV9cPuZiloKBtiTyjXyM8CE5G8sHRqlB-ec6VyMGkbfUoBOK36wCgVMfs6UHpl6oahhCwj~SNEpiNGMLSnaupSt9E8bbbIIuzR5UtOBJvEqxQLK-5K77~okiv2pSA21uyfgkX9dEBbKbCiMrPpv8exmVeMg~vFfMhC7MJIOoaCZ6SQ2t1r8~8ewhgXjG2IIrC729wTw__&#038;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJROXZ7FN26MABHYA"></a></p>

<p><strong>Gamestorming with Dave Gray</strong> – I read <em>Gamestorming</em> earlier this year and found it to be a very useful book for developing ideas and working on teams. Dave gave some examples from his book and how companies like Starbucks are listening to customers and changing their strategies for the better.</p>
<p>Dave pointed out that the question is no longer “What’s in tomorrow’s paper”, it’s now “What IS tomorrow’s paper?” Companies who approach it this way will get it right faster than those who are clinging tightly to old models that are going to slowly fade away. </p>
<p><span class="pullquote">The paradox of discovery is that you might not find what you’re looking for, but if you’re not looking for <em>something</em> then you won’t find <em>anything.</em>&nbsp; If you’re looking for the ROI before you start anything, you’ll never build anything. You don’t have to be smart, you just have to do things<span>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dave mentioned if you think you have a problem with overthinking it, you should go to <a href="http://overthinkingit.com/">http://overthinkingit.com</a>.&nbsp; For his book and more on Gamestorming, go to <a href="http://gogamestorm.com/">http://gogamestorm.com</a>. </p>

Brian Boyer from The Chicago Tribune and Scott Klein from ProPublica talked about news apps which are software. This is a new area, so these aren’t people in your company who can fix your computer or get the server back online, they’re people who can build newly capable applications to visualize stories or interact with users.</p>
<p>Apps that fall into this category include things like “Dollars for Docs” from ProPublica, which points out doctors who have taken money or other compensation from pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp; The speakers pointed out we need “Demos not memos.” In other words, we need more people in the field who can help to visualize and display and build these applications.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in working in this area, good places to start are things like Hacks &amp; Hackers, NICAR-L mailing list, a language like Python or Ruby, a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and informational, how-to sites for web designers/developers like <a href="http://developer.mozilla.com/">http://developer.mozilla.com</a> and <a href="http://alistapart.com/">http://alistapart.com</a>.&nbsp; Lots of other helpful links are here on Brian’s pinboard site: <a href="http://bit.ly/sndnerd">http://bit.ly/sndnerd</a>.</p>

The slides are great because they point out that a lot of what news designers have been trained to do are very useful skills for web design. Things like grids, typography and being able to organize volumes of information are all skills that can transfer to web design.</p>
<p>As with the previous speakers, they mention that it’s important to teach yourself to code and recommended Coda. They design in the browser but still use InDesign occasionally. </p>
<p>You can find the Upstatement slides from this talk here: <a href="http://upstatement.com/sndstl/">http://upstatement.com/sndstl/</a></p>

<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Tweet" border="0" alt="Tweet" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image20.png" width="540" height="88"><strong>Adios, Arial! New Tools for Taking Beautiful Typography from Print to Digital</strong> – Typography is so important for readability on the web, and Alan Tam, Sam Berlow and Danny DeBelius gave a great talk and examples on why you need to test every scenario, why the results can change and some technology to use to help. Sam recommended tools like the web font preview on <a href="http://www.fonts.com/">http://www.fonts.com</a>, the fontswapper on <a href="http://www.webtype.com/">http://www.webtype.com</a> and <a href="http://fontfonter.com/">http://fontfonter.com</a> to try web fonts on any website.</p>
<p>Great fonts can render totally differently on different operating systems, different devices, different browsers, so it’s important to test the fonts you’ve selected everywhere. It’s also important to make sure you’re using complementary fonts, which is probably hard to eyeball unless you’re a very seasoned web font user. </p>

Robin and Matt are amazing speakers and it’s definitely worth watching their take on what the future of reporting a natural disaster might be like with their video called The Storm Collection and the brilliant talk that follows: </p>
<p><iframe style="border-right-width: 0px; outline-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" height="340" src="http://cdn.livestream.com/embed/sndupdate?layout=4&amp;clip=pla_9f89cb53-2d61-4c6a-9d5d-74d10d387032&amp;height=340&amp;width=560&amp;autoplay=false" frameborder="0" width="560" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>END OF DAY 2</strong></p>
<p>I’m very used to attending technology conferences with topics I’m more or less familiar with. It’s been a long time since I have been to an event where I felt that every talk I walked away from had new ideas and new things for me to learn. As I said in the beginning of this post, it’s overwhelming. Although I’ve always been a newspapers and magazine junkie, that’s not what I studied in school. Without a journalism background, I felt out of my element. It’s uncomfortable to be in that position, but I realize we probably don’t do that enough to ourselves. </p>
<p>SND STL was incredibly well put together and I am so grateful to the organizers for all their hard work and effort.&nbsp; I will definitely be attending SND again in the future, hope to see everyone next year in Cleveland.</p>

Every time I looked at the schedule I got excited. Plus the SND STL website was one of the best conference sites I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>I had signed up for a pre-conference workshop on data visualization. Having done a graduate course last year in designing and creating data visualizations, I wasn’t sure how much of it would be duplicate, but I figured I could use a refresher. Plus the workshop speakers were from The New York Times, Duke University and Investigative Reporters and Editors, so these were people with some unbelievable backgrounds and experiences.&nbsp; The workshop was really good, and I walked away with some very useful resources.&nbsp; We spent time in Excel of course, but also Google Fusion Tables &amp; Google Refine.&nbsp; We took a look at several open source tools I hadn’t heard of to better parse and massage data.&nbsp; Lastly we looked at some public projects from US news websites and their blog entries or overviews of how they built their solution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here is a list of some of the resources we walked through, I hadn’t heard of several of them so it was really helpful for me.</p>

<p>Their research also showed that GPS is one of the most important features for smart phone users, and good apps should incorporate it appropriately. Social media comes in second in terms of feature importance.</p>
<p>For news sites, having usable mobile capability typically adds 10-20% to traffic. However the number is greatly affected in disaster or breaking news scenarios. As an example, CNN.com had 13.9 million mobile page views during the Japanese tsunami this year.</p>
<p>Tablet sessions are long, 58% of people use it for an hour at a time, 30% use it for &gt; 2 hours at a time. Daily.</p>
<p>What are they doing on the tablets? Using engaging, longer form, higher production value applications like games, magazines and video. Newspapers like the Daily Telegraph found tablet owners are not generally interested in breaking news, more interested in more detail and interactive pieces. </p>

Tim had amazing ideas on how to engage readers, keep them interested and get them to have fun. Which is especially relevant today with so much depressing news. Ideas Tim mentioned included things like predicting awards shows ahead of time, fun quizzes, games to tell news stories, using comics to explain difficult or complex stories, and a lot more.

It was a good panel where each aggregator talked about their decisions on multiple platforms, how much setup to give the user (i.e., do you seed them with feeds, let them choose, etc.), how they allow users to share, revenue streams and more. My takeaway from this was that these are in a dangerous spot as they rely a great deal on the lack of pay walls or a system to integrate with news sites. The aggregators don’t want to do a ton of work for each site they allow their users to access so the tougher a news site’s pay wall, the more likely the aggregators won’t include it. Having just seen the <em>fantastic</em> film <a title="Page One: Inside the New York Times" href="http://www.magpictures.com/pageone/" target="_blank">Page One: Inside the New York Times</a>, I fear what could happen if everyone stops paying for news or thinks they’re entitled to quality reporting for free forever. So while the aggregators do provide eyeballs, it seems there needs to be money changing hands somewhere for people to be able to use these apps. All three apps are currently free, but it doesn’t seem to be a sustainable model.</p>

Very good session on the tools they use, how they spend their time and production flow. I was terrified to learn that at The Daily, there are 50 people on just the design team, and that they have no automatic templates so every day they handcraft over 100 pages. Then they do it again in portrait mode. Yikes.</p>

Adonis talked about creating pages and layouts that make people think and surprise them. He showed a lot of examples of his papers’ compelling designs and “Wow factor” creations. He cited hiring a diverse team with different backgrounds and voices as one of the defining factors of his successful transformation of the papers from unknown to award-winning.

		<p>Last week’s look at Irish Newspaper websites and applications was a bit depressing.&nbsp; So this week, I’m looking at some of the newer and more tech-friendly alternatives: TheJournal.ie and Storyful.&nbsp; Neither of these news sources have alternative print formats, they are both digital-only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a title="TheJournal.ie" href="http://thejournal.ie/" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="TheJournalLogo" border="0" alt="TheJournalLogo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TheJournalLogo.png" width="240" height="63"></a>THEJOURNAL.IE</strong></p>
<p><a title="TheJournal.ie website" href="http://www.thejournal.ie/" target="_blank">TheJournal.ie</a> is an Irish news website which invites users to “shape the news agenda.”&nbsp; Produced and owned by Distilled Media, TheJournal.ie has partner sites for business, sports and entertainment news as well (all linked in the top navigation bar).&nbsp; While it’s been around since early 2010, TheJournal.ie is currently in public beta. This means the site is visible to the general public, although it may continue to test and trial new features so there may be glitches or new bits and pieces from time to time.</p>
<p><a title="TheJournal.ie" href="http://thejournal.ie/" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="TheJournal.ie Front Page" border="0" alt="TheJournal.ie Front Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TheJournal_FrontPage.png" width="460" height="414"></a></p>
<p>TheJournal.ie’s front page is a modern and less formal site powered by WordPress. It is attractive and easy to navigate.&nbsp; The tagged thumbnails and summaries are great and make it easy to browse headlines and stories. My only complaint is that some of the animated advertisements on the front page, like the Fine Gael one above are quite jittery and take away from the ability to pay attention to the headlines &amp; summaries. Other advertisements I’ve seen on the site are much nicer, notably the ones produced by other Distilled Media sites like boards.ie.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Tagged Articles" border="0" alt="Tagged Articles" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image.png" width="303" height="298"></p>
<p>The “Trending tags” link at the top of the front page (and also waaaayyyy at the bottom) shows off TheJournal.ie’s ability to do something most other Irish newspaper sites can’t/don’t: tagging articles.<a href="#taggingFootnote">*</a> Clicking one of the trending tags shows a list of articles relevant to that tag, when the article was posted, how many views &amp; comments it has had, a brief summary and quick links to share via Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Link to Mobile Site" border="0" alt="Link to Mobile Site" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TheJournal_LinkToMobileSite.png" width="447" height="240"></p>
<p>TheJournal.ie has a mobile version of their website which can be accessed at <a href="http://m.thejournal.ie/">http://m.thejournal.ie</a> or by clicking the link at the bottom of the main page as shown above.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="TheJournal.ie iPhone app main page" border="0" alt="TheJournal.ie iPhone app main page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-12-11-59.png" width="228" height="357">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="TheJournal.ie iPhone app article view" border="0" alt="TheJournal.ie iPhone app article view" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-12-12-39.png" width="229" height="353"></p>
<p>The mobile website is excellent and streamlined, focusing on the top main story and the most recent stories with a small downward arrow icon to allow the user to switch to one of the different online properties. As the list of articles is long, it can take a bit of scrolling to get to things like trending tags or most commented articles.&nbsp; The articles themselves are fantastic, very easy to read with nice typography and images.&nbsp; I tried the mobile site on both an iPhone and a Windows Phone 7 and both looked great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="TheJournal.ie iPad app splash screen" border="0" alt="TheJournal.ie iPad app splash screen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-12-22-42.png" width="235" height="319">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="TheJournal.ie iPad app in the App Store" border="0" alt="TheJournal.ie iPad app in the App Store" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-10-37-21.png" width="235" height="319"></p>
<p>As far as apps go, TheJournal hardly needs any because the mobile site works so well. However the iOS apps add a nice navigation bar at the bottom for Latest, Most Popular, Opinion, More and timely events like the Rugby World Cup.&nbsp; But the best part about the iOS app, which they should definitely advertise more loudly, is the offline capability. The app allows a user to download between 30-120 articles and their images so that you can read while offline.&nbsp; I tried this while in airplane mode on my flight today and it was great, the only things inaccessible are of course online videos.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="TheJournal iPhone Offline Options" border="0" alt="TheJournal iPhone Offline Options" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-12-26-51.png" width="228" height="352">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Reading TheJournal.ie offline" border="0" alt="Reading TheJournal.ie offline" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-12-30-01.png" width="222" height="347"></p>
<p align="left">Navigation in the iOS app takes a little bit of getting used to, you can scroll through the articles and swipe or tap the sides to move to the previous or next article. The Search function is hidden in the “More” section. It might be more useful on the main navigation or if the tags are sufficient for most users, it could probably be removed.</p>
<p align="left"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Navigation of TheJournal.ie iPad app" border="0" alt="Navigation of TheJournal.ie iPad app" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-12-27-02.png" width="249" height="341">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Swiping between TheJournal.ie iPad app articles" border="0" alt="Swiping between TheJournal.ie iPad app articles" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-12-28-48.png" width="248" height="340"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although TheJournal.ie is still relatively new, it boasts over 800,000 monthly visitors, 60,000 readers on the Android &amp; iOS apps, and an additional 80,000 Facebook &amp; 20,000 Twitter followers.&nbsp; Very impressive stats for a group that has to compete with more established and familiar Irish news sources. I am confident that TheJournal.ie will continue to grow and increase its presence and influence in the Irish news space. I would definitely not be surprised if this was a model they could abstract out and license to other areas similar to Ireland where the main news sites are more old school and less adaptive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a title="Storyful website" href="http://storyful.com/" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Storyful Logo" border="0" alt="Storyful Logo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/storyfulLogo.png" width="205" height="61"></a>STORYFUL.COM</strong></p>
<p><a title="Storyful website" href="http://storyful.com/" target="_blank">Storyful</a>, now a little over one year old, uses a different approach to TheJournal.ie and most other news websites by taking the perspective that there is always someone closer to the story.&nbsp; Sources might be local news professionals or amateurs, but they’re often simply regular people who are in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Storyful website" border="0" alt="Storyful website" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/StoryfulFrontPage.png" width="524" height="301"></p>
<p>Storyful has a “storybuilding tool” on their site which allows users to publish directly to the website.&nbsp; Users can post to community pages and share stories with friends on Facebook and Twitter to reach an audience all around the world.&nbsp; It’s a unique model which allows Storyful to share the stories it collects with news sources and major global news organizations all over the world.&nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Storyful Storybuilding tool" border="0" alt="Storyful Storybuilding tool" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-13-26-21.png" width="336" height="455"></p>
<p>Navigating Storyful’s website is not incredibly obvious if you’re looking for a more standard style of news website. Storyful’s front page presents a few thumbnails of what’s happening now along with things like Around the World in 18 Tweets and real-time Twitter updates.&nbsp; Towards the bottom it has regular spots like Curator’s Choice and Community Stories which highlight specifically chosen stories.&nbsp; However if you’re looking for a story that happened yesterday or some general news headlines for European financial stories, it’s not really built for that style of navigation. You can use the search bar to search by topic, but Storyful is not “the daily newspaper.”&nbsp; Storyful is latest news, worldwide news, told by courageous people affected by the story.&nbsp; If you want great storytelling and fascinating insights and the most up-to-date developments, this is the place. If you want stock closing prices and the sports scores from yesterday, you’re probably better off on a more traditional news website.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Storyful main page" border="0" alt="Storyful main page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-13-07-37.png" width="237" height="328">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Storyful Article View" border="0" alt="Storyful Article View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-05-10-2011-13-13-39.png" width="241" height="327"></p>
<p>Storyful has a vibrant community of contributors, and their contributions are in various languages, accompanied with photos, videos, tweets and comments, often from people at the scene of unfolding breaking news.&nbsp; There is no other way to feel closer to a brand new story than by watching these posts get put together and reading what develops.&nbsp; I know the feeling of continually refreshing Twitter searches for breaking news like the Arab Spring events and London Riots because no news site is going to have the latest turn of events, and feeling thrown into the moment while reading quotes from people who are witnessing it happen. Reading a great Storyful item is a bit like that, but much better organized and with supporting media.</p>

<p>There is no <a href="http://m.storyful.com/">http://m.storyful.com</a>, and unfortunately it doesn’t adapt much for smaller screen sizes, so if you are using it on a phone you will have to do some panning and zooming.&nbsp; However it looks decent on an iPad, better in landscape mode than in portrait mode, which leaves a lot of unused whitespace at the bottom.&nbsp; There are definitely some optimizations Storyful could do for mobile devices and smaller screens, a responsive layout being one.&nbsp; Another thing that might be useful is be a “snap-and-upload” instant story creation tool.&nbsp; With Storyful’s audience being worldwide, they’ve done the right thing by avoiding mobile apps and just focusing on the website to reach the most people. Many poorer and rural areas use very barebones phones but can still access the web with them; allowing these would-be reporters to maintain access to the story building tool is key. It would also be interesting to see geolocation functionality here, something like a “Breaking news near me” type of option.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">Something Storyful got right that no one else has yet in Ireland is the personal, behind-the-scenes connection from their blog at <a href="http://blog.storyful.com/">http://blog.storyful.com/</a></span>. This is a great way to show upcoming developments, share what’s new and how it works if relevant, showcase insights gained from analytics and user feedback and just generally let users understand the folks behind the creation of the site a little better.&nbsp; Storyful’s blog has bits and pieces about recent stories they’ve posted, but it also has some very insightful posts on how and why it works the way it does.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing more Irish news sites follow their lead and be more transparent about their inner workings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This area is so fascinating to watch because without the baggage of an existing brand, new news sources can do some very interesting things.&nbsp; Things like Facebook and Twitter integration are not mere add-ons for these sites, they’re integral to how the sites work.&nbsp; Embracing new ways of communicating and sharing helps these sites to grow their audience, and in a time where ad spend is vital to survival, audience statistics will go a long way to building and keeping advertiser revenue.</p>
<p>Looking at Google Trends is one way to see general traffic over time, and you can see below that for 2011, traffic is decreasing slightly to bigger sites while jumping around but still slowly increasing over time for TheJournal.ie (Storyful stats were unavailable so they’re not on the chart). These are very forward-thinking organizations and I applaud their hard work and determination to break the status quo.</p>

<p><a name="taggingFootnote">*</a>Unless you’re talking about The Independent’s random highlighting of words inside articles, which is very bizarre and certainly not helpful. I was reading a food article recently which had two hyperlinks in it: path and tricky. Clicking either word took you to a page where any other articles containing the word path or tricky were listed. Why would that ever be useful? The Independent needs to lose that automatic linking, whatever it is.</p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, I did <a title="Tuesday Newsday: Worldwide News Sites" href="/index.php/2011/08/tuesday-newsday-worldwide-news-sites/" target="_blank">an analysis of some worldwide news source apps</a> and websites, one of which was <em>The Irish Times</em>. Apparently many people had not seen <em>The Irish Times</em>’ iOS app and I received a lot of feedback from people on the blog, on Twitter and in person expressing disappointment and, in one instance, embarrassment, in local newspapers’ lack of tech savvy and design. </p>
<p><span class="pullquote">I wanted to know if <em>The Irish Times</em> were unique in their approach and who in the Irish newspaper scene was creating the most cutting-edge and user-friendly experiences.</span> Today I’m looking at the other two big, daily Irish broadsheet newspapers, <em>The Irish Independent</em> and <em>The Irish Examiner</em>, and next time I’ll cover some of the newer, digital-only initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Independent.ie" href="http://independent.ie/" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Independent front page" border="0" alt="Irish Independent front page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image20.png" width="526" height="515"></a></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">THE IRISH INDEPENDENT</font></strong></p>
<p><em>The Irish Independent</em> was formed in 1905 as the direct successor to the <em>Daily Irish Independent.</em>&nbsp; Today it is published daily by Independent News and Media (INM), an international newspaper and communications group.&nbsp; Independent Digital is the digital consumer division of INM and operates websites such as Independent.ie, and Herald.ie, with Independent.ie being the flagship brand.</p>
<p>Looking at <em>The Irish Independent</em>’s website, my first thought was, “Thank goodness they have an iPad app”(this turned out <em>not</em> to be as big of a relief, but more on that later). There is just so much content and so many ways to read it, and the site does not adjust well for an iPad-sized device.&nbsp; Trying to navigate to <a href="http://m.independent.ie/">http://m.independent.ie</a> gives you the following error.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Photo-27-09-2011-17-16-29.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Navigating to m.independent.ie" border="0" alt="Navigating to m.independent.ie" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Photo-27-09-2011-17-16-29_thumb.png" width="392" height="531"></a></p>
<p>On the bottom of the front page of the main site (and you do have to scroll for a while, there is a lot of content there!) you’ll see this: </p>
<p><a title="Independent.ie mobile applications" href="http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/independentie-mobile-applications-1921410.html" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image21.png" width="540" height="52"></a>which shows you that you do have some options to view using mobile devices.&nbsp; The RSS page has links to feeds for basically every category such as Personal Finance, Horse Racing, European News, etc. The Mobile page lists their various custom apps, including iPhone, Nokia, Samsung Wave (!) and iPad versions.&nbsp; I looked on the Windows Phone Marketplace as well but didn’t see any official or unofficial Independent apps (WP7 developers, take note!).</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Independent iPad App" border="0" alt="Irish Independent iPad App" align="left" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Photo-29-09-2011-09-14-15.png" width="230" height="312"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Independent iPad App" border="0" alt="Irish Independent iPad App" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Photo-29-09-2011-09-14-28.png" width="221" height="304"> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <em>Irish Independent</em> is using the same software <em>The Irish Times</em> are using for their iPad app. I really hope this isn’t setting the precedent for Irish news experiences, that would be so sad. The silver lining is that since both of these apps use external payment systems, it’s just a matter of time before they’re kicked out of the App Store for violating Apple terms and conditions.&nbsp; Whether they’ll adapt the software they use to work with Apple’s in-app subscription purchases or abandon it and try something else remains to be seen.&nbsp; I do hope that the numbers tell the right story for both newspapers and they try a different, more appropriate approach for the iPad rather than deciding that “people aren’t spending money on news apps”, as that is definitely not the case.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Independent iPhone Article View" border="0" alt="Irish Independent iPhone Article View" align="left" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Photo-28-09-2011-20-04-48.png" width="221" height="341"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Independent iPhone Article View" border="0" alt="Irish Independent iPhone Article View" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Photo-28-09-2011-20-05-53.png" width="222" height="344"> </p>
<p>The sad thing about the iPad app is that the iPhone app is so much better. Containing the most popular sections of <em>The Irish Independent</em>’s website, the iPhone app has access to breaking news, business, sport, entertainment, travel, health and others. Users can customize the menu bar with their favourite sections, and the app can be synched so that the user can read offline later.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image22.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Sign up for for Independent.ie e-mail newsletters" border="0" alt="Sign up for for Independent.ie e-mail newsletters" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image_thumb7.png" width="481" height="345"></a></p>
<p>If you don’t have a compatible mobile device and you’re not an RSS user, <em>The Irish Independent </em>also offer e-mail updates and Facebook integration.&nbsp; The newsletter process is maybe a bit long with four separate screens, but the e-mails are nicely formatted and contain a large amount of news content from various categories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image23.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Independent Digital Edition subscription page" border="0" alt="Irish Independent Digital Edition subscription page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image_thumb8.png" width="534" height="447"></a></p>
<p>There is such a wide variety of approaches by <em>The Irish Independent</em> that I have a lot of hope they’ll be the first ones in Ireland to get it right.&nbsp; While the varied attempts show potentially changing priorities or investments, there is certainly no doubt that they are very willing to try anything and everything.&nbsp; The picture above and below are examples of something you can find on the <em>Independent</em>’s website, something called the “Digital Edition.”&nbsp; It’s very much like the ePaper approach, where you have the full scan of the page and you have to zoom, pinch and pan around to read any stories.&nbsp; Definitely an odd take, but one way it might be useful would be if you could download it. As I have a long flight back to the US tomorrow, if I didn’t have an iPad, I might consider zipping up a paper in this format and saving it to my desktop to read the next day.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image24.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Independent Digital Edition zoomed in" border="0" alt="Irish Independent Digital Edition zoomed in" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image_thumb9.png" width="540" height="454"></a></p>
<p>I mentioned above that for me, the real value here is not downloading a zip file of large image scans of news, but in seeing the work that <em>The Irish Independent</em> are investing in to finding the best strategy and executing it. I have high hopes for their future digital attempts and will keep a close eye on them.</p>

<p><strong>THE IRISH EXAMINER</strong></p>
<p><em>The Irish Examiner</em> is a publication of Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited. It was formerly <em>The Cork Examiner</em> and then <em>The Examiner</em>, and it has been around since 1841 when it was founded by John Francis Maguire. I couldn’t find any information on when they started their digital presence unfortunately, the Wikipedia entry is a bit thin.</p>
<p>At first glance, the front page of <a href="http://irishexaminer.com/">http://irishexaminer.com</a> looks cleaner and less cluttered than other Irish news websites.&nbsp; There is a lot of white space and less “cramming” than many other front pages.&nbsp; The number of advertisements at the top of the page, though, is a bit distracting.&nbsp; Looking at the above image, the myhome advertisement on the right is outside of the width of the rest of the content, which makes it feel odd or misplaced, and the top NIB banner ad also feels like it’s in a frame outside of the page. The Office365 ad appears slightly more normal inside the page with the rest of the content.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Examiner Navigation Menu with Digital Edition link" border="0" alt="Irish Examiner Navigation Menu with Digital Edition link" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image26.png" width="531" height="93"></p>
<p><em>The Irish Examiner</em> does not have an iPhone or iPad app, but they do use the same “Digital Edition” system that <em>The Irish Independent</em> are using.&nbsp; Lets agree that we don’t need to cover that anymore.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Examiner Digital Edition" border="0" alt="Irish Examiner Digital Edition" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image27.png" width="465" height="265"></p>
<p>Visiting <a href="http://m.irishexaminer.com/">http://m.irishexaminer.com</a> results in a server not found error, however on their Mobile link, they mention <a href="http://m.examiner.ie/">http://m.examiner.ie</a> which resolves to a very bare but usable page with an <em>Irish Examiner</em> logo at the top, three top news story links and some additional links to Breaking News, Ireland, World, Sport, etc.&nbsp; Not the most beautiful page but it is easier to use than trying to look at <a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/">http://www.irishexaminer.com</a> on your phone.</p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Irish Examiner Mobile site article view" border="0" alt="Irish Examiner Mobile site article view" align="left" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Photo-28-09-2011-20-21-31.png" width="218" height="337"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see a little in <em>The Irish Examiner </em>that I do in <em>The Irish Independent: </em>an intent to build something useful, the acceptance that news is moving online and that they need to do something about it.&nbsp; But I also see some confusion, some budget constraints and some trepidation in investing too much time and money in an unsure area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHO ELSE?</strong></p>
<p>Am I missing someone who is doing something really fantastic with digital news in Ireland? There are a lot of regional newspapers, so I’m going through them all, but if you have seen something great that you enjoy using or hope other news sources adopt, please leave a comment or let me know.</p>
