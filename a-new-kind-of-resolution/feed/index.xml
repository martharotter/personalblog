					<description><![CDATA[Tom, thanks for the pointer, will check it out. Sounds like either way I win. 

However I must admit that I&#039;m equally excited about the fact that your comment means that my ever-flowing wisdom is not blocked by the Chinese government &amp; therefore readable there. You&#039;re welcome, China!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For meditation, someone recommended to me a book called &quot;Real Happiness.&quot; He then mentioned you can skip the book and download the audio files and it&#039;s just as good ( http://www.workman.com/static/realhappinessebook/ ). If you feel bad about downloading the audio files and not paying, you can probably try to meditate away the stress. If it works you&#039;re all set, and if it doesn&#039;t work, then you can be glad you didn&#039;t pay for them.

I tried listening to the first one and I fell asleep. I&#039;m not sure if that means it worked or it didn&#039;t.]]></description>
