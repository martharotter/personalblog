					<description><![CDATA[Hi Greg, 

Thanks very much for your comment and for taking a look. I agree, I think it would be really interesting to take a look at how the media outlets are perceiving the individual candidates. Great idea. I&#039;ll take a look this week and see if I can put together some sentiment data from news sites.

Thanks again Greg.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Martha,
Thats very interesting. Wouldn&#039;t it be interesting to see what the data looks like relative to media sources? I.e. does &#039;RTE&#039; reflect broadly negative sentiment or conversations and, for example, does &#039;MRBI&#039; reflect positive sentiment? Taking it a step further how about individual presenters...&#039;Marian&#039;,&#039;Vincent&#039;,&#039;George&#039;,&#039;Sean&#039; etc. 

Just a thought. 
Cheers,
Greg]]></description>
